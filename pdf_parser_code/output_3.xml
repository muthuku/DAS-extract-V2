ABSTRACT
When exposed to stressful conditions, eukaryotic cells respond by
inducing the formation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes
called stress granules. Here, we use C. elegans to study two proteins
that are important for stress granule assembly in human cells – PQN-
59, the human UBAP2L ortholog, and GTBP-1, the human G3BP1
and G3BP2 ortholog. Both proteins assemble into stress granules in
the embryo and in the germline when C. elegans is exposed to
stressful conditions. Neither of the two proteins is essential for the
assembly of stress-induced granules, as shown by the single
and combined depletions by RNAi, and neither pqn-59 nor gtbp-1
mutant embryos show higher sensitivity to stress than control
embryos. We find that pqn-59 mutants display reduced progeny
and a high percentage of embryonic lethality, phenotypes that are not
dependent on stress exposure and that are not shared with gtbp-1
mutants. Our data indicate that, in contrast to human cells, PQN-59
and GTBP-1 are not required for stress granule formation but
that PQN-59 is important for C. elegans development.

of these conditions might be sensed as a stressful stimulus by the
cell. In return, cells activate the integrated stress response pathway,
which leads to translation inhibition of most mRNAs and to the
assembly of stress granules (Kedersha et al., 2013). Stress granules

of proteins and RNA molecules into liquid droplets through a
mechanism of liquid–liquid phase separation (Hofmann et al.,

into stress granules, and their composition varies according to the
cell type and the triggering stress (Aulas et al., 2017; Markmiller
et al., 2018).

Formation of stress-induced granules is a reversible process;
hence removal of the stress stimulus results in dissolution of
the granules. The current model describing the pathway through
which cells assemble stress granules involves disassembly of
the polysomes with consequent translation inhibition either via
phosphorylation of
the translation initiation factor eukaryotic
initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) (Kedersha et al., 1999) or via the
inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor 2G (eIF4G) (Mokas et al.,
2009). The mRNAs released from the polysomes are then bound to
RNA-binding proteins and recruited into the stress granules (Buchan
and Parker, 2009; Fay and Anderson, 2018). In mammalian cells,
together with the translation initiation factor eIF2, other proteins
are important nucleators of stress granules. These include Ras
GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and
G3BP2) and ubiquitin associated protein 2-like (UBAP2L), which
are crucial to drive stress granule assembly in many stress conditions
(Cirillo et al., 2020; Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020;
Kedersha et al., 2016; Markmiller et al., 2018; Youn et al., 2018),
and the protein T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen protein (TIA-1)
(Gilks et al., 2004; Kedersha et al., 1999).

Although the exact

function of stress granules and their
importance for cell survival and organismal development have not
yet been established, stress granules may exert a protective role on
cells when they are exposed to stress (Protter and Parker, 2016).

Stress granule assembly and function has been mainly studied in
unicellular organisms and cells in culture. The nematode C. elegans
provides an excellent model to study stress granules and to address
their role in organismal viability. The proteins involved in stress
granule formation in mammalian cells are conserved, and the
formation of granules molecularly similar to the mammalian stress
granules has been observed in the somatic and germ cells of
C. elegans (Huelgas-Morales et al., 2016; Jud et al., 2008; Kuo
et al., 2020; Lechler et al., 2017; Rousakis et al., 2014).

C. elegans contains one ortholog of the mammalian G3BP1 and
G3BP2, called GTBP-1 (Sfakianos et al., 2018) and two TIA-1 and
TIAR orthologs (Silva-García and Navarro, 2013), named TIAR-1
and TIAR-2. GTBP-1 has been only recently shown to contribute
to stress granule formation in C. elegans worms (Kuo et al., 2020).
TIAR-1 protects germ cells from heat shock (Huelgas-Morales
et al., 2016), and TIAR-2 granules inhibit axon regeneration
(Andrusiak et al., 2019). The potential C. elegans ortholog of
UBAP2L is a protein called Prion-like (glutamine/asparagine-rich)
domain bearing protein (PQN-59) (Shaye and Greenwald, 2011;
Spike et al., 2014). The similarity between PQN-59 and UBAP2L at
the sequence level is only 30% (source: BlastP), but PQN-59
and UBAP2L share a very similar domain organization (Fig. 1A).
As for GTBP-1, PQN-59 is an abundant protein of the entire
C. elegans proteome (https://pax-db.org/protein/1033201; Wang
et al., 2015; Carlston et al., 2021 preprint), but its role in C. elegans
has not been characterized.

Here, we show that different stress stimuli trigger the formation of
granules containing both PQN-59 and GTBP-1 in C. elegans
embryos and germlines. In contrast to what has been shown in
human cells, we find that neither of the two proteins is essential for
stress granule assembly in the embryo, but each contributes to the
recruitment of the other to granules. Consistent with this inter-
dependence, we show that GTBP-1 and PQN-59 interact in a two-
hybrid assay. PQN-59 RNAi depletion or deletion results in
embryonic lethality and reduced progeny numbers in normal growth
condition, phenotypes that were not observed following the
depletion or deletion of GTBP-1. This suggests that PQN-59
plays additional roles in the development of worms.

RESULTS
PQN-59 is a component of stress granules
The UBAP2L protein is important for stress granule assembly in
many stress conditions and acts upstream of the stress granule
components G3BP1 and G3BP2 in this process (Cirillo et al., 2020;
Huang et al., 2020; Markmiller et al., 2018; Youn et al., 2018). We
set out to investigate whether the C. elegans ortholog of UBAP2L,
called PQN-59 (Fig. 1A), is also a component of stress granules.

We used a CRISPR/Cas9-generated strain expressing both an
endogenous C-terminal
fusion of PQN-59 with GFP, and of
the ortholog of human G3BP1 and G3BP2, GTBP-1 fused
with RFP (Fig. 1A,B; Table S1). Both PQN-59 and GTBP-1 are
expressed throughout development, and are widely expressed in adult
C. elegans animals, including in the germline and the embryo
(Fig. 1B).

Observation of untreated pqn-59::GFP;gtbp-1::RFP embryos
revealed that both proteins are cytoplasmic (in the embryos and in the
germline; Fig. 1C,D). When embryos were exposed to heat shock
(30°C, 5 min) using a temperature-controlled stage, PQN-59
assembled into granules in both the anterior and posterior
blastomeres (Fig. 1C). These granules colocalized with GTBP-1
granules (Fig. 1C). Similar to what is seen for stress granules in
human cells (Wheeler et al., 2016), lowering the temperature to 20°C
following heat-shock exposure resulted in dissolution of the PQN-59
and GTBP-1 granules after ∼10–15 min of recovery (Fig. 1C).

We investigated whether PQN-59 and GTBP-1 assembled into
granules in the C. elegans germline following high temperature
exposure. We found that
in pqn-59::GFP;gtbp-1::RFP worms
exposed to 35°C for 10 min, PQN-59 assembled into granules in
both the distal and proximal germline (Fig. 1D). These granules
colocalized with GTBP-1 granules and dissolved after ∼10 min of
incubation at 20°C (Fig. 1D), confirming that
their formation
depends on stress exposure and is reversible. Therefore, heat stress
induces the formation of PQN-59- and GTBP-1-containing granules
in the C. elegans germline.

We then asked whether PQN-59 and GTBP-1 assembled into
granules when embryos and worms were exposed to other stresses.
Sodium arsenite induces oxidative stress, triggering the formation of
stress granules (Rousakis et al., 2014). We treated embryos with
perm-1(RNAi) to permeabilize the eggshell (Carvalho et al., 2011)
and incubated them with 20 mM arsenite for 1 h (Fig. 2A,B). This
resulted in appearance of PQN-59 granules that colocalized with
GTBP-1 granules in both anterior and posterior cells in 80% of
embryos (Fig. 2B). Formation of stress granules relies on polysome
disassembly, which is inhibited by the addition of the drug
cycloheximide (e.g. Kedersha et al., 2000). Exposure to both
arsenite and cycloheximide (250 μg/ml; Lee et al., 2020) inhibited
formation of PQN-59 and GTBP-1 granules (Fig. 2A,B), indicating
that formation of these granules depends on polysome disassembly.

Germlines from adult worms incubated in a solution containing
20 mM arsenite for 5 h also displayed granules containing both
PQN-59 and GTBP-1 (Fig. 2C,D) in the proximal and distal
germline. The translation inhibitor puromycin promotes polysome
disassembly and stress granule formation (Huelgas-Morales et al.,
2016; Kedersha et al., 2000). We asked whether incubation with
puromycin induced PQN-59 and GTBP-1 granule formation. As
shown in Fig. 2C,D, worms incubated for 4 h in a solution
containing 10 mg/ml of puromycin showed the appearance of PQN-
59 granules that colocalized with GTBP-1 in the distal and the
proximal germline. This suggests that the GTBP-1- and PQN-59-
containing granules are stress granules, as they form when polysome
disassembly is promoted.

To conclude, the exposure of C. elegans embryos and animals to
different stress conditions results in the formation of PQN-59
cytoplasmic granules that colocalize with the known stress granule
component GTBP-1. Release from heat shock results in granule
dissolution and,
in embryos, cycloheximide addition inhibits
formation of arsenite-induced granules. These data indicate that
PQN-59 behaves as a stress granule component.

The number of GTBP-1 granules is reduced in PQN-59 RNAi
depleted embryos
We next asked whether PQN-59 has an important role to form stress
granules, as has been shown for UBAP2L (Cirillo et al., 2020;
Huang et al., 2020; Markmiller et al., 2018; Youn et al., 2018). To
do this we undertook RNAi experiments; for these, silencing of
specific genes will be indicated as gene(RNAi) or protein name (in
capital) RNAi depletion [e.g. pqn-59(RNAi) or PQN-59 RNAi
depletion, with ctrl(RNAi) being control(RNAi)].

In ctrl(RNAi) embryos exposed to 34°C, we observed numerous
granules containing PQN-59 and GTBP-1 in both the anterior AB
and posterior P1 cells of two-cell embryos (Fig. 3A). When heat
shock was applied to pqn-59(RNAi) embryos, GTBP-1 assembled
into granules in both the anterior and posterior cells (Fig. 3A).
Whereas in heat-shocked ctrl(RNAi) embryos GTBP-1 granules
appeared as spherical and defined speckles, in heat-shocked pqn-
59(RNAi) embryos, GTBP-1 formed more diffuse granules (Fig. 3A).
Quantifications of the GTBP-1 signal revealed that in pqn-59(RNAi)
embryos, the number and the intensity of GTBP-1 granules were
reduced compared to that seen in control embryos (Fig. 3B). The
RNAi depletion of PQN-59 was efficient (Fig. 3A; Fig. S1A,B) and,
on average, did not result in a change of GTBP-1 levels in embryos,
although GTBP-1 levels became more variable (Fig. S1B).

To exclude that a residual pool of PQN-59 after RNAi depletion
could account for GTBP-1 granule formation after stress exposure,
we inserted a stop codon in the second exon of PQN-59 in a strain
expressing GTBP-1::GFP, which resulted in the pqn-59(cz4);gtbp-
1::GFP strain (Table S1). Expression of PQN-59 was absent in
this strain (Fig. 3C). In control embryos exposed to heat shock, we
observed GTBP-1 granules (Fig. 3D). These granules contained
mRNAs, as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
using a poly(A) probe (Fig. 3D), indicating that the PQN-59 and
GTBP-1 granules formed after heat shock are ribonucleoprotein
complexes, like stress granules. Consistent with the results obtained
in the pqn-59(RNAi) embryos,
in pqn-59(cz4);gtbp-1::GFP
embryos exposed to heat shock, GTBP-1 assembled into granules,
which also contained mRNAs (Fig. 3D). The GTBP-1 granules
were, however, less numerous and less intense (Fig. 3D–F), and we
could observe poly(A)-positive granules that had very weak or no
GTBP-1 signal (marked with asterisks in the magnified images of
Fig. 3D).

s.d. n indicates the number of samples and N the number of independent experiments.The P-value was determined using one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s
multiple comparisons test. Scale bars: 10 μm.

We noticed that in both pqn-59(RNAi) and pqn-59(cz4) mutant
embryos that were not exposed to heat shock, GTBP-1 formed
granules in the posterior P1 blastomere (Fig. S1A,C). These granules
colocalized with P body and P granule markers (Fig. S1D,F) and
contained mRNAs (Fig. S1G) (Gallo et al., 2008). The average
number of P bodies and their intensity was not different in control
and pqn-59(RNAi) embryos (Fig. S1E)
indicating that RNAi
depletion of PQN-59 does not affect P body assembly.

Heat-induced GTBP-1 granules dissolved when the temperature
was shifted back to 20°C. Images of wild-type embryos fixed
after heat shock and after 5, 10 and 20 min of recovery at
20°C, confirmed that GTBP-1 stress-induced granules were still
present after 5 min of recovery, and were not detected after 10 min
(Fig. 3E,F). In pqn-59(cz4) embryos, most GTBP-1 stress-induced
granules were already dissolved after 5 min of recovery in the
anterior blastomere (Fig. 3E,F). The granules in the posterior
blastomere did not dissolve, consistent with the fact that their
formation is not dependent on heat-shock exposure (Fig. 3E;
Fig. S1A–G).

We then asked whether GTBP-1 granules can form in the
germline when PQN-59 is depleted. We found that RNAi depletion
of PQN-59 led to a reduction of GTBP-1 levels (Fig. 3G,H).
Formation of GTBP-1 granules was not observed in the oocytes
(proximal germline) of pqn-59(RNAi) worms exposed to heat shock
(Fig. 3G,I). However, dim GTBP-1 granules were still observed
around the nuclei of the syncytial germline (distal germline,
Fig. 3G,I), indicating that, similar to the situation in the embryo,
GTBP-1 granules can still form, although not throughout the entire
germline, despite the fact that GTBP-1 levels are reduced.

The RGG domain of UBAP2L is crucial to nucleate stress
granules in human cells (Huang et al., 2020; Youn et al., 2018). We
deleted this domain in the pqn-59::GFP;gtbp-1::RFP strain
(Fig. S2A; Table S1) and tested whether PQN-59ΔRGG could
still form granules after heat shock. As shown in Fig. S2B,C, PQN-
59ΔRGG was nucleating granules that colocalized with GTBP-1,
similar to the granules formed in the wild-type strain. Quantification
of both PQN-59 and GTBP-1 granule number and intensity revealed
similar values between the wild-type parental strain and the pqn-
59::ΔRGG::GFP;gtbp-1::RFP strain (Fig. S2B,C).

Our data show that when PQN-59 is absent, GTBP-1 granules
still assemble in the embryo and in the distal germline after heat
shock, but not in oocytes. The GTBP-1 granules are reduced in
number, appear different from the stress granules assembled in the
control strain and dissolve faster. The deletion of the RGG domain
of PQN-59 alone is not sufficient to impair granule assembly,
indicating that
in this process in
C. elegans embryos.

this domain is not essential

GTBP-1 contributes to the assembly of stress-induced
PQN-59 granules
In mammalian cells, the G3BP proteins are crucial to assemble
stress granules
(Guillén-Boixet
et al., 2020; Kedersha et al., 2016; Sanders et al., 2020; Yang
et al., 2020). We therefore investigated whether GTBP-1 was
required for the assembly of PQN-59 granules in C. elegans after
heat shock.

PQN-59 was diffused in the cytoplasm, as in ctrl(RNAi) embryos
(Fig. S3A,C). In gtbp-1(RNAi) embryos exposed to heat shock,
some PQN-59 granules were still observed in both AB and P1 cells
(Fig. 4A). A significant decrease in PQN-59 number and intensity
could be quantified in GTBP-1-depleted embryos compared to
control embryos (Fig. 4B). The dim PQN-59 granules formed in

absence of GTBP-1 contained mRNAs, as shown by in situ
hybridization (Fig. 4C). In addition, we observed poly(A) granules
that did not show a clear PQN-59 enrichment (asterisks in the inset
of Fig. 4C). In gtbp-1(ax2068) embryos that were not exposed to
heat shock, the poly(A) signal was detected in P1 cells (Fig. S3C),
consistent with a localization in P granules.

The absence of GTBP-1 did not significantly reduce the levels of
PQN-59 (Fig. S3A,B), indicating that the impaired stress granule
assembly did not depend on a change in protein amount. The stress-
induced PQN-59 granules formed in the absence of GTBP-1 also
dissolved in a shorter time following stress ceasing (Fig. 4D,E).
Whereas in heat-shocked wild-type embryos, granules were still
present after 5 min of recovery at 20°C and started to dissolve after
10 min, in gtbp-1(ax2068) mutant embryos, the PQN-59 granules
already started disappearing after 5 min of recovery at 20°C
(Fig. 4D,E), suggesting that
the biophysical properties of the
granules formed in absence of GTBP-1 are altered compared to
control conditions.

RNAi depletion of GTBP-1 also impaired PQN-59 granule
assembly in the germline. Following heat exposure, dim PQN-59
granules were still visible around the nuclei in the distal germline. In
the proximal germline, undefined PQN-59 aggregates were
observed (Fig. 4F,G). Given that PQN-59 levels were not altered
following GTBP-1 RNAi depletion (Fig. 4H), this phenotype does
not depend on a change in protein amount.

The observation that after PQN-59 RNAi depletion GTBP-1
stress-induced granules are reduced in number and less intense, and
that, similarly, after GTBP-1 RNAi depletion PQN-59 granules are
reduced in number and less intense suggests an interdependence
between these two proteins in their localization to granules. We
therefore tested whether PQN-59 and GTBP-1 interact.
In
agreement with data in other model systems (Baumgartner et al.,
2013), and with co-immunoprecipitation analysis from C. elegans
embryos (Carlston et al., 2021 preprint) PQN-59 interacted with
GTBP-1 in two-hybrid assays, as shown by growth on selective
medium of yeast colonies expressing GTBP-1 and PQN-59
(Fig. 4I).

We conclude that when GTBP-1 is depleted, stress-exposed
embryos contain less numerous and less intense PQN-59 granules.
In GTBP-1-depleted germlines, PQN-59 still assembles into

granules in the distal and in poorly defined aggregates in the
proximal germline.

TIAR-1 granules assemble in embryos depleted of both
GTBP-1 and PQN-59
Since depleting PQN-59 did not abolish formation of GTBP-1
granules and, vice versa, depleting GTBP-1 did not abolish the
formation of PQN-59 granules after exposure to stress, we asked
whether the absence of both proteins would result in a defect in the
formation of stress granules. To address this question, we used the
protein TIAR-1 as a marker. In C. elegans, TIAR-1 accumulates in
stress granules in the germline (Huelgas-Morales et al., 2016) and in
the intestine of worms (Kuo et al., 2020) following exposure to
different stresses. We used a strain expressing TIAR-1::GFP
(Huelgas-Morales et al., 2016) and found that in our heat shock
conditions (35°C for 10 min), TIAR-1 also assembled in granules
that colocalized with GTBP-1 granules in the distal and proximal
germline (Fig. S4A).

accumulated

into

stress-induced

In the C. elegans embryo, TIAR-1 is localized in the cytoplasm
and it accumulates in the nuclei and the P granules of the germ
precursor cells (Fig. 5A,C; Huelgas-Morales et al., 2016; Silva-
García and Navarro, 2013). Following heat shock of the embryo,
TIAR-1
granules which
colocalized with PQN-59 (Fig. 5A). RNAi depletion of PQN-59
did not abolish TIAR-1 granule formation after heat-stress exposure
(Fig. 5A). Our quantifications showed that the number and the
intensity of TIAR-1 granules was not significantly different
compared to the control (Fig. 5B). However, we observed a
higher variability in the PQN-59-depleted embryos, consistent with
the fact that some embryos appeared to have fewer TIAR-1 granules.
In tiar-1::GFP;gtbp-1(ax2029);ctrl(RNAi) embryos that were heat
shocked, the majority of TIAR-1 granules were detected in the P1
cell (Fig. 5A), but the overall number and intensity of TIAR-1
granules was not significantly different from the wild-type parental
strain (Fig. 5B). In this condition, consistent with the result shown in
Fig. 4A,B, PQN-59 formed granules in both AB and P1 cells, and
these granules colocalized with TIAR-1 granules (Fig. 5A). When
PQN-59 was depleted in the tiar-1::GFP;gtbp-1(ax2029) embryos,
TIAR-1 granules were still observed after heat shock, and their
number and intensity was not significantly different from the
number and intensity quantified in the control and in the gtbp-
1(ax2029) mutant (Fig. 5B). The TIAR-1 granules that formed in
the tiar-1::GFP;gtbp-1(ax2029);pqn-59(RNAi) embryos contained
mRNAs as shown by FISH with a poly(A) probe (Fig. 5C). The
number and intensity of poly(A) granules was also not significantly
different for either the single or the double mutant (Fig. 5D). This
suggests that the absence of both PQN-59 and GTBP-1 proteins is
not sufficient to abolish the assembly of TIAR-1 stress-induced
granules. In embryos that were not exposed to heat shock, the
localization and appearance of TIAR-1 was not affected by the
RNAi depletion of PQN-59, the mutation of GTBP-1 or both, and
the poly(A) probe colocalized with TIAR-1 granules in the P1 cell
(Fig. 5A,C). Given that we did not observe a significant difference
in TIAR-1 granule number and intensity between the single and
double mutant, we measured TIAR-1 granule dissolution in tiar-1::
GFP and in tiar-1::GFP;gtbp-1(ax2029) embryos. We found that
the granules dissolved with similar dynamics
(Fig. 5E,F),
suggesting that
the absence of GTBP-1 does not perturb the
properties of TIAR-1 granules.

We then asked whether formation of PQN-59 and GTBP-1
granules is abolished or reduced when TIAR-1 is mutated. As
shown in Fig. 6A,B, the number and intensity of PQN-59 and

GTBP-1 granules was reduced in tiar-1(tn1543) mutant embryos
exposed to heat shock. The number and intensity of poly(A)
granules was also reduced in these embryos (Fig. 6C,D). The
localization and levels of GTBP-1 and PQN-59 did not change in
tiar-1(tn1543) embryos not exposed to heat shock (Fig. S4B,C), and
the poly(A) signal was found in granules in the posterior P1 cell as
in control (Fig. S4D).

TIAR-1 is required to form stress-induced CGH-1 containing
granules in the gonad core, but CGH-1-containing granules still

form in the oocytes in tiar-1 mutants (Huelgas-Morales et al., 2016).
We found that granules containing both PQN-59 and GTBP-1 still
form in germlines from tiar-1(tn1543) worms exposed to heat shock
(Fig. S4E–G), although the signal from PQN-59 granules appeared
reduced (Fig. S4F).

These results indicate that PQN-59 and GTBP-1 are not required
for the formation of TIAR-1 granules. TIAR-1 is also not essential for
assembly of PQN-59 and GTBP-1 granules but it contributes to it as
fewer PQN-59 and GTBP-1 granules assemble in the tiar-1 mutant.

PQN-59 is required for embryonic development and
maintenance of brood size in a stress-independent manner
As PQN-59 and GTBP-1 contribute to proper granule formation
following heat shock, we next investigated whether these two
proteins are important for other functions in C. elegans, in normal
growing conditions and therefore independently of a stress
response.

We first asked whether the progeny number is affected by the
RNAi depletion of PQN-59, GTBP-1 or both. We measured the
progeny laid in 24 h and found that RNAi depletion of PQN-59
resulted in a significant reduction of progeny number whereas the
RNAi depletion or null mutation of GTBP-1 did not (Fig. 7A,B).
Co-depleting both PQN-59 and GTBP-1 or depleting PQN-59 by
RNAi in the gtbp-1 mutant resulted in an increase in brood size
compared to that seen with PQN-59 RNAi depletion alone
(Fig. 7A,B). We then measured the brood size in pqn-59 mutant
and found that, consistent with the reduced number of eggs laid in
24 h, the brood size was reduced (Fig. 7C). We observed that gtbp-1
mutant worms, on the opposite, had a significant increase in the
brood size compared to control (Fig. 7C).

Depleting by RNAi PQN-59 resulted in ∼50% embryonic lethality
(Fig. 7D) a value similar to the PQN-59 mutant (Fig. 7F). These
results suggest
that PQN-59 has an important function during
embryonic development. By contrast, RNAi depletion or mutation of
GTBP-1 did not result in significant embryonic lethality (Fig. 7D–F).
Depleting GTBP-1 by RNAi did not increase lethality of pqn-
59(RNAi) embryos compared to the RNAi depletion of PQN-59 alone
(Fig. 7D), and rather it weakly rescued (see Discussion). This result
was confirmed by the RNAi depletion of PQN-59 in the gtbp-1
mutant (Fig. 7E).

We then dissected embryos

from wild-type and mutant
hermaphrodites, exposed them to 34°C for 10 min (Fig. 7G) and
analysed how this treatment impacted on their viability. After 24 h
of recovery at 20°C, we found that embryonic lethality ranged from
∼70% to ∼80% and we did not detect a significant difference
between the wild-type and the mutant embryos (Fig. 7H).

Taken together our results suggest that PQN-59 and GTBP-1 do
not help embryos to better resist to exposure to heat. They also
indicate that PQN-59 has additional roles in adult life and during
development that are independent of GTBP-1 and stress granule
formation.

DISCUSSION
Here, we have studied the function of two conserved proteins, PQN-
59, the ortholog of UBAP2L, and GTBP-1, the ortholog of G3BP1
and G3BP2 in assembly of stress granules in worm embryos and in
worm germlines. Both PQN-59 and GTBP-1 are cytoplasmic
proteins that condense into granules in response to stress exposure
(this study; Carlston et al., 2021 preprint; Kuo et al., 2020). While
these proteins have been shown to be crucial nucleator of stress
granules in human cells (Cirillo et al., 2020; Guillén-Boixet et al.,
2020; Huang et al., 2020; Kedersha et al., 2016; Markmiller et al.,
2018; Youn et al., 2018), we find that neither the single nor
the double RNAi depletion of these proteins result in the abrogation
of formation of stress-induced granules in C. elegans embryos as
detected by TIAR-1::GFP and poly(A) FISH (for a summary of the
stress granule phenotypes in the different mutants, see Fig. 7I).

In Drosophila melanogaster, Lingerer (the PQN-59 ortholog)
and Rasputin (the GTBP-1 ortholog) interact in yeast two-hybrid
assays (Baumgartner et al., 2013). In human cells, G3BP-1 and
UBAP2L co-immunoprecipitate, and mutations in UBAP2L that
abolish the interaction with G3BP-1 are unable to rescue the stress
granule assembly defect of UBAP2L RNAi depletion (Huang et al.,
2020; Youn et al., 2018). C. elegans GTBP-1 has been isolated in
pulldowns of PQN-59 from embryos (Carlston et al., 2021 preprint),
and we found that PQN-59 and GTBP-1 interact
in a yeast
two-hybrid assay, supporting the hypothesis that PQN-59 and
GTBP-1 are in a complex in C. elegans. In contrast with their human
orthologs, the interaction of these two proteins or their presence is
not essential for the formation of stress-induced granules, as
revealed by assessing the behavior of GTBP-1 or PQN-59 and
TIAR-1 (Fig. 7I). However, we observed less PQN-59 granules
when GTBP-1 was absent and, vice versa, less GTBP-1 granules
when PQN-59 was absent (Fig. 7I). This could be either due to a
general reduction of the number of stress granules or to the ability of
these proteins to be recruited to stress granules when one of them is
mutated. The number of TIAR-1 and poly(A) granules did not
significantly change in the single or double PQN-59 and GTBP-1
RNAi depletions (Fig. 7I). This indicates that PQN-59 and GTBP-1
are not essential for the assembly of stress granules and suggests that
they contribute to, but are not strictly essential for, the recruitment of
each other to stress granules. The recruitment in the single mutants
may occur via interaction of PQN-59 or GTBP-1 with other stress
granule proteins or via binding to RNAs, as we find that the stress-
induced granules formed in these mutants do contain mRNAs. The
faster dissolution of the PQN-59 granules in the gtbp-1 mutant
and, vice versa, of GTBP-1 granules in the pqn-59 mutant may
suggest that the interaction between these two proteins stabilizes
their localization to stress granules but does not affect the properties
of stress granules per se. Consistent with this, the dissolution of
TIAR-1 granules is not different in control and gtbp-1 mutant
embryos.

Deletion of

the RGG domain of UBAP2L results in the

PQN-59 also contains a RGG domain (Fig. 1A), which is 18%
identical and 28% similar to the RGG domain of UBAP2L (aligned

using the EMBOSS pairwise alignment). We find that deletion of
the PQN-59 RGG domain does not result in defects in the number of
stress granules, nor in PQN-59 recruitment
is
interesting that a deletion of the RGG domain in the P granule
component PGL-3 does not abrogate PGL-3 granule formation.

number of samples and N the number of independent experiments. Scale bars:
10 μm. Enlarged ROIs are on the right.

PGL-3ΔRGG is, however, unable to recruit other P granule
components (Hanazawa et al., 2011). If the RGG domain of
PQN-59 were responsible for PQN-59 and/or GTBP-1 recruitment
into the stress granules, we would have expected the RGG mutant to
show a similar phenotype to the deletion or RNAi depletion of
PQN-59. All this suggests that interactions with other stress granule
components are maintained in the RGG mutant. It would be
therefore interesting to identify the specific domains of PQN-59
involved in its recruitment to granules, interaction with protein
partners and/or interaction with RNA molecules.

The single and double RNAi depletion of GTBP-1 and PQN-59
did not reduce the average number of TIAR-1 granules, but granule
number was more variable, suggesting that PQN-59 and GTBP-1 do
at
least partially facilitate TIAR-1 granule formation. This is
different from what has been observed in the intestine of C. elegans
larvae, where GTBP-1 RNAi depletion resulted in a reduction of
TIAR-1 granule number but did not fully abolish the formation of
stress granules (Kuo et al., 2020). We find that, in the embryo, a
mutation in TIAR-1 does not abolish PQN-59 and GTBP-1 stress-
induced granule assembly either. However, the number of GTBP-1,
PQN-59 and of poly(A) granules was reduced suggesting that
TIAR-1 has a more important role in the process of stress granule
formation in C. elegans embryos. The second C. elegans TIA-1
ortholog, TIAR-2, is expressed in the germline (Jud et al., 2008) and
has redundant roles with TIAR-1 in regulating brood size and
embryonic viability when the temperature is upshifted from 20 to
25°C (Huelgas-Morales et al., 2016). It will be interesting to
investigate whether TIAR-1 and TIAR-2 double depletion results

in a stronger reduction in GTBP-1, PQN-59 and poly(A) granule
formation when embryos are exposed to stress. It will also be
interesting to study whether PQN-59 has a more prevalent role in
stress granule assembly in other C. elegans tissues.

Altogether, our data show that none of these proteins is strictly
required for stress-induced granule assembly. So, whereas in cultured
human cells G3BPs and UBAP2L are important for the formation of
stress granules in many stress conditions (Cirillo et al., 2020; Guillén-
Boixet et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Kedersha et al., 2016; Matsuki
et al., 2013; Youn et al., 2018), in C. elegans, heat-stress-induced
granules can form in the embryo in the absence of GTBP-1, PQN-59,

in the absence of both and in the absence of TIAR-1. This suggests
different possibilities: (1) that an essential nucleator of stress granules
has still to be identified in C. elegans; (2) that there is strong
redundancy; and/or (3) that the presence of disordered proteins is
sufficient for the assembly of stress-induced granules in worm
embryos. Our work is reminiscent of work in intestinal progenitor
cells in Drosophila where canonical nucleators are not required for
stress granule formation (Buddika et al., 2020). In this system, even a
triple mutant of ATX2 (atx2), TIAR1 (rox8) and G3BP (rin) still
assembled stress-induced granules as detected by the Fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP) (Buddika et al., 2020).

Stress granules have been proposed to protect cells from stress.
We find that exposure to heat stress kills wild-type, pqn-59 or gtbp-1
mutant embryos to the same extent. This is consistent with the result
that stress granules still assemble in pqn-59 and gtbp-1 mutant
embryos and reveals that these two factors are not crucial to protect
C. elegans embryos from stress. In tiar-1 mutants, in which we find
that GTBP-1, PQN-59 and poly(A) granules are reduced in number,
embryonic lethality is increased after heat stress compared to control
(Huelgas-Morales et al., 2016), suggesting that having enough
stress granules may be important to protect embryos.

RNAi depletion and mutation of PQN-59 result in additional
phenotypes, such as slow growth, reduced progeny and embryonic
lethality, all in absence of stress. These phenotypes were not observed
in gtbp-1 mutant or depleted animals. A recent paper has shown that
the human orthologs, G3BP1 and G3BP2 inhibit mTORC1 signaling
by targeting mTORC1 to the lysosome (Prentzell et al., 2021). One
possibility is that the phenotypes of pqn-59 mutant embryos are
dependent on GTBP-1. For example, an excess of free GTBP-1 (not
in complex with PQN-59) could be deleterious for worms and
embryos. In addition, in pqn-59 mutant embryos not exposed to stress
we observed that, in the P1 cell, GTBP-1 localizes to granules that
colocalize with P body and P granule markers, suggesting the
hypothesis that this aberrant localization is deleterious to embryos.
Co-depletion of both PQN-59 and GTBP-1 by RNAi resulted in a
weak rescue of the embryonic lethality and the reduced progeny
phenotypes of pqn-59 mutants, indicating that these phenotypes
might depend on an excess of free GTBP-1 or on any role that GTBP-
1 might play when localized on P bodies/P granules, but only
partially. Why GTBP-1 localizes to other granules in absence of stress
in pqn-59 mutants is not clear. One possibility is that, in non-stress
conditions, GTBP-1 has a tendency to phase separate stronger than
PQN-59. This tendency would normally be inhibited by the presence
of PQN-59. An alternative possibility is that the region of GTBP-1
responsible to interact with PQN-59 may also interact, more weakly,
with P body or P granule components, an interaction that could be
revealed when PQN-59 is absent.

The fact that the rescue of lethality observed in the double RNAi
depletion is weak suggests that PQN-59 has additional important
functions in embryos and worms that do not depend on GTBP-1.
These yet
to be identified functions could contribute to the
regulation of the response to stress or be completely independent
of the role of PQN-59 in stress granule assembly. Additional studies
will be required to understand the molecular functions of PQN-59
and its role in maintaining embryonic viability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains
The C. elegans strains used in this work are listed in Table S1. Worms were
maintained on NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria, using standard
methods (Brenner, 1974). All the strains were grown at 20°C and incubated
at 20°C after dsRNAs injections.

Mutant strains were generated using CRISPR/Cas-9 technology, as
described in Arribere et al. (2014). Single-guide RNAs and repair templates,
as well as PCR primers used to detect and sequence the mutations, are listed
in Tables S2 and S3, respectively. The pqn-59 mutant strain {generated in
the N2 background and in the JH3199 (gtbp-1(ax2055[gtbp-1::GFP])IV)
background} was generated by introducing a frameshift mutation leading to
the appearance of a premature STOP codon. The pqn-59::ΔRGG strain was
generated excising the RGG-rich region (from amino acid position 122 to
189), not altering the reading frame.

RNA interference
A list of the genes silenced through RNAi in this study is provided in
Table S4.

Clones from the Ahringer feeding library (Ahringer, 2006; Kamath et al.,
2003) were used when available. As a control, we used the clone C06A6.2,
previously found in the laboratory to not affect early embryonic division
and development (injected worms are 100% viable). To produce pqn-59
dsRNA, a DNA fragment was amplified from genomic DNA using
Gateway-compatible oligonucleotide primers (as in Table S4) for Gateway-
based-cloning into the pDESTL4440 plasmid (Addgene plasmid #11344).
The DNA was subsequently amplified using standard T7 primers. For tiar-1,
the DNA was amplified from genomic DNA using oligonucleotides with T7
overhangs (see Table S4). For all genes, the dsRNA was produced with the
Promega Ribomax RNA production system. dsRNA was injected in L4 or
young adult hermaphrodites, which were incubated at 20°C. Germlines or
embryos collected from injected hermaphrodites were analyzed 24 h after
injection.

Live imaging of embryos exposed to heat shock
Gravid hermaphrodites were dissected on a coverslip into a drop of egg buffer
(118 mM NaCl, 48 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, and 25 mM
HEPES pH 7.5) containing a 1:10 volume of polystyrene beads (Polybead®
Hollow Microspheres, Polysciences). The temperature controller CherryTemp
(Cherry Biotech, Rennes, France) with its accompanying software (Cherry
Biotech TC) was used to control the temperature during the live imaging
process. The coverslip with dissected hermaphrodites was directly mounted
on the chip of the CherryTemp microfluidic temperature control system. The
system was mounted on a Leica DM6000 microscope, equipped with
epifluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) optics, and a DFC
360 FX camera (Leica). Time lapse images were collected every 10 s using a
63×/1.4 numerical aperture (NA) objective and LAS AF software (Leica
Biosystems). Imaging was started at 20°C. The temperature was then shifted at
30°C (heat shock) for 5 to 10 min while imaging. For recovery,
the
temperature was shifted back to 20°C for 15–20 min (Fig. 1C).

Embryonic drug treatment and image acquisition procedure
Drug treatment of C. elegans embryos was performed on permeabilized
eggs. For this, young adult hermaphrodites were injected with perm-1
dsRNA and incubated at 20°C for 16 h after the injection. perm-1(RNAi)
embryos were than extruded from the gravid hermaphrodite in a solution of
egg buffer or 20 mM arsenite (MerckMillipore) diluted in egg buffer or
20 mM arsenite plus 250 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma Life Sciences,
C7698-1G; Lee et al., 2020) diluted in egg buffer on a 22×40 mm
coverslips. The coverslips with dissected worms and embryos were
incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a humid chamber.

After the incubation time, the coverslip was mounted on a 3% agarose pad
for imaging. Imaging was performed using the Leica DM6000 described
above. Images were acquired using the 63×/1.4 numerical aperture (NA)
objective and the LAS AF software (Leica Biosystems). The percentage of
granule-containing embryos was counted.

Hermaphrodite heat shock, drug treatment and image
acquisition procedure
For heat shock, young adult worms were transferred into a drop of M9 buffer
(86 mM NaCl, 42 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4 and 1 mM MgSO4) on a
glass coverslip and transferred on a metal block placed into a humidified
incubator for 10 min at 35°C. For recovery after heat shock, worms were
collected from the M9 drop and transferred onto OP50 seeded NGM plates
and incubated at 20°C for 5 or 10 min.

For drug treatment, young adult worms were transferred into a drop of M9
buffer only (control) or in 10 mg/ml of puromycin (InvivoGen) or with
20 mM arsenite (MerckMillipore). Worms were incubated in the
puromycin-containing solution for 4 h and in the arsenite-containing
solution for 5 h before imaging. Control worms were incubated in M9 buffer
for the same amount of time as the puromycin or arsenite-treated worms.
Control and drug-treated worms were then transferred in a drop of NaN3
30 mM (for worm paralysis) and mounted on a 3% agarose pad for imaging.
Imaging was performed using the Leica DM6000 described above. Images
were acquired using the 63×/1.4 numerical aperture (NA) objective and the
LAS AF software (Leica Biosystems).

Immunostaining of embryos and image acquisition procedure
For C. elegans embryos staining, 20–25 gravid hermaphrodites were
dissected in a drop of M9 buffer on 22×40 mm coverslips. Control samples
were left at room temperature (20–22°C) for 10 min. For heat shock
exposure, coverslips with dissected worms and embryos, were transferred on
a metal block placed in a humidified incubator at 34°C for 10 min. For
recovery, after the heat shock, the coverslip was transferred on a metal block
at room temperature (20°C).

After the incubation time, the coverslip was mounted crosswise on the
epoxy slide square (Thermo Fisher Scientific), previously coated with 0.1%
poly-L-lysine, for embryonic squashing. The slides were then transferred
on a metal block on dry ice for at least 10 min. Afterward, the coverslip
was removed (freeze-cracking method) before fixation. Immunostaining
was performed as described in Spilker et al. (2009). Briefly, embryos were
fixed for 20 min in methanol and placed for 20 min in a solution of PBS and
0.2% Tween 20 (PBST) and BSA 1% to block the nonspecific antibody
binding. The slides were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBST
with 1% BSA overnight at 4°C. The list of primary antibodies used in this
study is in Table S5. After two washes of 10 min each in PBST, slides were
incubated for 45 min at 37°C with a solution containing secondary
antibodies (4 µg/ml Alexa Fluor 488- and/or 568-coupled anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse antibodies from Molecular Probes) and 1 µg/ml DAPI to
visualize DNA in PBST. Slides were then washed two times for 10 min in
PBST before mounting using Mowiol [30% (w/v) glycerol, 3.87 mM
Mowiol
(Calbiochem, 475904), 0.2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, and 0.1%
DABCO].

In the case of GFP- or RFP-tagged strains, the slides were briefly (10 min
at room temperature) incubated with 1 µg/ml DAPI in PBST to visualize
DNA just after methanol fixation and blocking. Slides were then washed
two times for 10 min in PBST and mounted with Mowiol.

Images were acquired using a Nikon A1r spectral (inverted Ti Eclipse)
confocal microscope equipped with a 60×1.4 NA CFI Plan Apochromat
Lambda oil objective and four photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) including
two highly sensitive detectors (GaAsp) for the green and red channels.
Five to seven z-stacks, separated by 0.5 µm, were acquired. NIS Elements
AR software (v.4.20.01; Nikon) was used to set acquisition parameters.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization
The FISH protocol
is adapted from Lee et al. (2020). FISH probes
recognizing poly(A) tails of mRNA molecules were designed using
Biosearch Technologies’ Stellaris Probe Designer. The probe used in this
study is a 30dT oligonucleotide coupled at the 3′ with the Quasar Q670
fluorophore.

For sample preparation, as described above, embryos were extruded
from gravid hermaphrodites in a drop of M9 on 22×40 mm coverslips.
Control samples were left at room temperature (20–22°C) for 10 min. For
heat-shock exposure, coverslips with dissected worms and embryos, were
transferred onto a metal block placed in a humidified incubator at 34°C for
10 min. After the incubation time, the coverslip was mounted crosswise on the
epoxy slide square, previously coated with 0.1% poly-L-lysine, for embryonic
squashing. The slides were then transferred on a metal block on dry ice for at
least 10 min and subjected to freeze-crack, followed by cold methanol fixation
at −20°C. For rehydration, samples were washed once with 0.5× PBS with
0.1% Tween 20 and methanol (1:1) and once with 0.5× PBS with 0.1%
Tween 20, followed by five other washes in 1× PBS plus 0.2% Tween 20.
Samples were subsequently fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma Life Sciences) diluted in
PBS for 1 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. After PFA fixation,
samples were again washed four times in 1× PBS with 0.2% Tween 20, twice
in 2× SSC (0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M sodium citrate), and once in wash buffer
(10% formamide, 2× SSC). The blocking step was performed incubating the
samples in Hybridization Buffer [10% formamide, 2× SSC, 200 µg/ml
ultrapure BSA, 2 mM ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (NEBS, #S1402S),
0.2 mg/ml yeast total RNA (Roche, REF 10109223001), 10% dextran sulfate]
for 30 min at 37°C in a humid chamber. For hybridization, samples were
incubated overnight at 37°C with 50 nM probe solutions diluted in
hybridization buffer. Samples were subsequently washed twice in wash
buffer (each wash followed by an incubation of 30 min at 37°C), twice in
2× SSC, once in 1× PBS with 0.2% Tween 20, and twice in 1× PBS.

Finally, samples were mounted using Mowiol mounting medium with
1× DAPI.

Images were acquired using a Nikon A1r spectral (inverted Ti Eclipse)
confocal microscope, as described in Immunostaining of embryos and
image acquisition procedure above.

Quantification of cytoplasmic protein levels
The mean intensity of a defined region of interest (ROI) (w=2.69, h=2.46
pixels, area=6.604 pixels2), always placed in the anterior blastomere (AB) of
a two-cell stage C. elegans embryo or in the last oocyte of a C. elegans
germline, was measured using Fiji ImageJ. The mean intensity of an equal
ROI, placed outside of the embryo, was used for background subtraction.
For each experiment, the obtained mean intensity values were normalized on
the highest value for 0 to 100 (%) scale conversion.

Quantification of cytoplasmic granules
For the quantification of PQN-59, GTBP-1 and TIAR-1 embryonic
cytoplasmic granules, QuPath version 0.2.3 was used (Bankhead et al.,
2017). The algorithm for granule detection was based on a pixel classifier
and was trained on representative pictures with dedicated annotations. For
each manually delineated embryo, the total number of detected granules was
obtained. The average intensity of all the detected granules in each embryo
was background subtracted using the average embryonic intensity of the
same embryo.

Germline granules of epifluorescence pictures in Figs 3, 4 and Fig. S4,
were quantified using as a readout the standard deviation of the gray value of
a defined region of interest (ROI) (w=214, h=64 pixels, area=9088 pixels2).
Values were quantified in both the distal and proximal germline. A diffuse
signal gives a smaller standard deviation while a punctate signal, as seen for
stress granules, results in high standard deviation.

Yeast two-hybrid assay
The interaction between PQN-59 and GTBP-1 was assessed in the PJ69-4a
yeast strain (James et al., 1996) using single copy GAL4 activation and
GAL4 DNA-binding domain-based vectors. Full-length cDNAs were
cloned into these vectors using Gibson reactions and transformed into the
host yeast strain using previously described protocols (James et al., 1996).
Transformants were selected on SC −Leu −Trp plates and subsequently
tested for growth (3 days) on SC −Leu −Trp −His plates containing 3 mM
3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT).

Protein domain identification
Protein domains were identified using the meta site Motif Scan tool, a free
database for protein motif prediction developed by the Swiss Institute of
Bioinformatics (SIB),
including Prosite, Pfam, and HAMAP profiles
(https://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/motif_scan). Comparable results were also
obtained interrogating other online tools, such as PROSITE at ExPASy
(https://prosite.expasy.org/), MOTIF (GenomeNet, Institute for Chemical
Research, Kyoto University, Japan) (https://www.genome.jp/tools/motif/),
and InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/).

Prion domains were identified using PLAAC (http://plaac.wi.mit.edu).

Antibody production
To produce antibodies against PQN-59, a C-terminal fragment (amino acids
304–712) was cloned using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen) into the
pDEST15. Recombinant GST-tagged PQN-59 was expressed in BL21 and
purified using standard protocols. Antibody production in rabbit was
performed by Covalab, France. The obtained anti-PQN-59 serum was
purified on membrane strip carrying bacterially expressed GST–PQN-59
antigen. Approximately 5 µg of fusion protein was loaded in each lane of a
10% acrylamide gel. The protein was transferred on a nitrocellulose
membrane (GE Healthcare). A stripe of the membrane, containing the
protein, was cut and incubated for 1 h in PBS plus 3% milk for blocking.
The band was then incubated overnight at 4°C in 1 ml of serum diluted in
1 ml of 3% milk in PBS with 0.01% Tween 20 plus 4 mg of GST (to
compete for a GST antibody binding). After three washes of 5 to 10 min, the
antibody was eluted using a solution of glycine 100 mM, pH 2. The pH of
the elution solution was equilibrated to 7.5 using 1 M Tris.

Western blotting
For western blotting, 50 adult worms were manually picked from NGM
plates, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and incubated at 92°C for
2 min. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% acrylamide gel.
Proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma). The
membrane was blocked with 3% milk dissolved in PBS and 0.01% Tween
20 (PBST). After washing with PBST,
the membrane was incubated
overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in a 1% BSA PBST
solution (see Table S5). The following day the membrane was washed with
PBST twice for 10 min and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in
the same solution [1:10,000 HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
antibodies (Biorad)] at room temperature for 45 min. After three washes of
10 min each, proteins were visualized with ECL (Millipore) using a Pxi
(Syngene) machine.

Embryonic lethality and brood size counting
To count embryonic lethality and the number of laid eggs, L4 or young adult
worms were singled onto individual OP50-seeded NGM plates and
incubated at 20°C for 24 h. After 24 h, the adult worm was removed, and
plates were again incubated at 20°C for 24 h. To assess the total number of
laid eggs, the number of non-hatched embryos and hatched larvae were
counted under a dissecting microscope. The ratio between the non-hatched
embryos over the total of the progeny was used to calculate the percentage of
embryonic lethality.

To count the total brood size, as shown in Fig. 7C, L4 animals were
manually transferred to individual NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria.
Adults were manually transferred onto new OP50-seeded NGM plates every
24 h until no more eggs were laid. The number of eggs laid and larvae
present on each plate was counted 24 h after the removal of the adult worm.
The number of eggs laid and larvae counted every 24 h was finally summed
up to assess the total brood size.

Embryonic lethality after heat shock
For embryonic lethality after heat shock, gravid hermaphrodites were
dissected on a coverslip into a drop of egg buffer where the embryos were
released. The coverslip was then transferred on a metal block placed in a
humidified incubator at 34°C for 10 min. After the heat shock, the embryos
were transferred by pipetting on OP50-seeded NGM plates, counted, and
incubated at 20°C for 24 h for recovery. After recovery, the number of non-
hatched embryos was counted. The ratio between non-hatched embryos over
the number of embryos plated was used to calculate the percentage of
embryonic lethality after heat shock exposure.
