While organ-conﬁned prostate cancer (PCa) is mostly therapeutically man-
ageable, metastatic progression of PCa remains an unmet clinical challenge.
Resistance to anoikis, a form of cell death initiated by cell detachment
from the surrounding extracellular matrix, is one of the cellular processes
critical for PCa progression towards aggressive disease. Therefore, further
understanding of anoikis regulation in PCa might provide therapeutic
opportunities. Here, we discover that PCa tumours with concomitant inhi-
bition of two tumour suppressor phosphatases, PP2A and PTEN, are par-
ticularly aggressive, having &lt; 50% 5-year secondary-therapy-free patient
survival. Functionally, overexpression of PME-1, a methylesterase for the

to correlate with increased apoptosis sensitivity. In summary, our results
demonstrate that PME-1 supports anoikis resistance in PTEN-deﬁcient
PCa cells. Clinically, these results identify PME-1 as a candidate biomarker
for a subset of particularly aggressive PTEN-deﬁcient PCa.

One of the hallmarks of PCa progression towards
aggressive CRPC is acquisition of resistance towards a
speciﬁc type of programmed cell death, anoikis [15].

1. Introduction

important

Prostate cancer (PCa) is often detected early and can
remain non-aggressive and non-metastatic for years
[1,2]. Whereas local PCa is not life-threatening, transfor-
mation from indolent to aggressive disease is clinically
the most
transition in PCa progression.
Thereby understanding this switch in more detail might
provide therapeutic opportunities. Analysis of the evo-
lutionary history of lethal metastatic PCa has revealed
that tumour suppressor proteins are particularly lost
during transition towards metastatic human PCa [1].
One such tumour suppressor is a dual-speciﬁcity phos-
phatase Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) that
is inactivated in a large fraction of high-grade PCas [3].
Both in human and mice, prostate-speciﬁc PTEN dele-
tion leads to an aggressive and metastatic PCa [3–5].
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is another tumour sup-
pressor phosphatase that is commonly inactivated in ag-
gressive PCa. Speciﬁcally, PP2A B-subunits PPP2R2A
and PPP2R2C (B55a and B55c) have been reported as
either genetically deleted or down-regulated in human
PCa samples [6–8]. PP2A is inactivated also non-
genetically in human cancers by overexpression of inhi-
bitor proteins such as CIP2A, PME-1 or SET [9,10].
CIP2A overexpression
associates with
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) [11], and
inhibition of both CIP2A and SET inhibits malignant
growth of PCa cells [11,12]. In contrast, the role of
PME-1 in PCa is currently unknown. PME-1 inhibits
PP2A activity both by directly binding to catalytic cen-
tre of the catalytic subunit PP2A-C, and by regulating
the methylation of
leucine 307 on
PP2A-C and thereby inhibiting recruitment of tumour
suppressive B-subunits to the PP2A complex [10,13,14].
Thereby, PME-1 expression levels provide an indirect
read-out for effective PP2A inhibition in cells and in
tissues.

the C-terminal

clinically

Anoikis is induced by detachment of cells from other
cells, or the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM).
Anoikis suppression is not only relevant for indolent
PCa cells to acquire anchorage-independence, but also
for survival of PCa cells with metastatic potential in
circulation [16,17]. Thus, understanding the mecha-
nisms driving anoikis resistance of PCa cells could pro-
vide novel therapy opportunities for clinical management
of PCa by facilitating inhibition of progression to meta-
static disease. Anoikis resistance in PCa has been linked
to changes in cell adhesion, cytoskeleton, and epigenet-
ics, as well as deregulated intracellular survival pathways
[15]. Activated integrin signaling is a central contributor
to anchorage-independence and metastasis [18,19], and
integrin activation correlates with anoikis resistance in
PCa cell
lines [20,21]. Recently, epigenetic regulation
of histone H3 methylation has also surfaced as an
important mechanism regulating apoptosis and anoikis
[22–24]. The role of PP2A in PCa anoikis sensitivity is,
however, poorly understood.

In this study, we demonstrate that PP2A inhibitor
protein PME-1, that has not been previously impli-
cated in PCa, has a critical role in anoikis suppression
of PTEN-deﬁcient PCa cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Clinically, PCa tumours with inhibition of both
tumour suppressor phosphatases PTEN (genetic dele-
tion) and PP2A (PME-1 overexpression) had remark-
ably short relapse-free survival introducing PME-1 as
a potential clinically applicable PCa biomarker.

transfection to reach 80–90% conﬂuency. Cells were
then transfected with 2.5 lg DNA, 5 lL P3000 reagent
and 3.75 lL Lipofectamine 3000 per well and assayed
24–48 h after transfection, unless otherwise stated.

2.5. Colony formation assay
Cells were reseeded at low conﬂuency (1–4 9 103) on
a 12-well plate 24 h after siRNA transfection and
grown for around 10 days to allow the formation of
cell colonies. Colonies were then ﬁxed with ice-cold
methanol and stained with 0.2% crystal violet solution
(in 10% ethanol) for 10 min at room temperature.
Excess stain was removed by repeated washing with
PBS. Plates were dried and scanned with Epson perfec-
tion V700 scanner. Quantiﬁcations were performed
with ColonyArea ImageJ plugin [25], and graphs were
plotted using the area % values.

2.10. Chick chorioallantoic membrane assay

The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), one of three
extraembryonic membranes formed during chick devel-
opment, provides a highly vascularized and immunode-
ﬁcient test environment, which is frequently utilized to
address cancer-relevant questions. Fertilized chicken
eggs were purchased from a certiﬁed hatchery (LSK
Poultry Oy, Laitila, Finland). According to the Direc-
tive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on the
protection of animals used for scientiﬁc purposes, the
CAM model system does not raise any ethical or legal
concerns. To start chick embryonic development for the
CAM assay, fertilized eggs were kept rotating in an
incubator at 37 °C and 50–60% humidity for 4 days.
After the initial incubation, a small hole was introduced
at the sharp edge of the egg and sealed with paraﬁlm.
Following four more days of incubation on stationary
racks, the hole was enlarged and a plastic ring was
placed on top of blood vessels in the CAM. Next,
1 9 106 PC-3 cells in 20 lL volume of a 1 : 1 mixture of
ice-cold PBS and matrigel were pipetted inside the ring
on the membrane. The hole was then covered with par-
aﬁlm, and the eggs were incubated for three more days.
At day 12 of embryonic development, the animals were
sacriﬁced by freezing the eggs for 15 min, and the
tumour cell mass was dissected from the membrane and
processed for further analysis.

Immunohistochemistry

PCa tissue microarrays have been described previously
[27]. Hematoxylin/eosin staining and immunohisto-
chemistry were performed on 3-lm-thick sections of 4%
paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded tissues.
Following rehydration, endogenous peroxidase was
blocked by incubation in 50% MetOH, 1% H2O2. Sub-
sequent antigen retrieval was performed with the 2100
Retriever (Aptum Biologics, Southampton, UK)
in
R-Universal Buffer. Unspeciﬁc antibody binding was
blocked with 10% goat serum in 2% BSA/PBS prior to
overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary antibody.
For detection, the DAKO EnVision peroxidase system,
followed by incubation with 0.01% diaminobenzidine
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used.

PC-3 cells were washed with PBS, stained with Cell-
Tracker Green CMFDA dye (5 lM, Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) and detacher and detached with trypsin–
EDTA in a single incubation step at 37 °C. Subse-
quently, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and
washed with PBS twice. This was followed by ﬁltration
through 40 lM mesh into Falcon FACS tube (Corning,
Corning, NY, USA, 352235) and pelleting cells by cen-
trifugation. Finally, cells were resuspended into 30 lL
of injection buffer (2% PVP in PBS) and kept on ice
until transplanted. Zebraﬁsh (Danio rerio) of pigment-
less casper strain (roy
) [29] was used in
the experiments under license no. MMM/465/712–93
(issued by the Finnish Ministry of Forestry and Agri-
culture) and following legislation: the European Con-
vention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used
for Experimental and other Scientiﬁc Purposes and the
Statutes 1076/85 and 62/2006 of The Animal Protec-
tion Law in Finland and EU Directive 86/609. The
embryos were obtained through natural spawning, and
were cultured in E3-medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM
KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4) at 33 °C. At 2
or 3 days post-fertilization, the embryos were anesthe-
sized with 200 mgmL
 1 Tricaine and embedded in
0.7% low-melting point agarose. Subsequently, the cell
suspension was microinjected into common cardinal
vein (duct of Cuvier) of the embryo using glass capil-
laries (Transfertip), CellTramVario microinjector and
InjectMan micromanipulator
from Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany). Embryos were liberated from
the agarose gel using forceps and successfully trans-
planted embryos were selected to the experiment. After
overnight incubation at 33 °C, the embryos were anes-
thesized again with Tricaine and imaged using Zeiss
StereoLumar V12 ﬂuorescence stereomicroscope. The
number of surviving cells was counted manually from
the images using IMAGEJ.

Cells were grown to approximately 80% conﬂuency on
sterilized coverslips, ﬁxed for 10 min in 4% PFA and
permeabilized for 10 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in
TBS. The subsequent steps were completed following
the manufacturer’s

unspeciﬁc antibody binding was blocked with the pro-
vided blocking solution for 30 min. The slides were
then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight
at 4 °C, with the mouse and rabbit probes for 1 h at
37 °C, with the ligation mix for 30 min at 37 °C and
the ampliﬁcation mix for 100 min at 37 °C. The wash-
ing steps in-between the individual steps were carried

out with Buffer A (Sigma) and the ﬁnal washing step
with Buffer B (Sigma). Slides were mounted in Mowiol
mounting medium and imaged with a Zeiss LSM780
confocal microscope.

Investigation of nuclear envelope integrity

PC-3 cells were transfected with PME-1 or control
siRNA as indicated above. After 24 h, the same cells
were transfected with both pCDH-CMV-NLS-copGFP-
EF1-blastiS and pCDH-CMV-cGASE225A/D227A-
mCherry2-EF1-blastiS [30] in a 1 : 1 ratio and incubated
overnight. Finally, the cells were detached, transferred
onto 0.5 kPa hydrogels and grown for an additional
24 h before ﬁxing. Lamin-A,C, NLS-GFP, cGAS-
mCherry and DNA were visualized using (immune)ﬂuo-
rescence microscopy. After thresholding, individual cells
were stratiﬁed and quantiﬁed based on the presence/ab-
sence of cytoplasmic NLS and cGAS foci.

times with PBS. To evaluate the degree of cell adhe-
sion to the coated wells, PC-3 cells were detached
using HyQTase (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT,
USA, SV30030.01) and 1 9 104 cells were seeded into
each well. The cells were left to adhere and spread for

To investigate the degree of anoikis in PC-3 cells grown
on surfaces with varying amounts of integrin ligand,
cells that had been transfected with control or PME-1-
targeting siRNAs approximately 48 h prior to the
experiment were seeded on a new 96-well plate coated
with 0–20% biotinylated PLL-g-PEG and streptavidin-
FNIII(7–10), at 5 9 103 cells per well. Each well was
supplemented with 1 : 200 Annexin V-FITC (eBio-
science), and additional wells with 20% biotinylated
PLL-g-PEG and FNIII(7–10) were supplemented with
1 lM staurosporine (STS) (Merck Millipore) to serve as a
positive control for apoptosis. The plate was imaged
every hour for &gt; 2.5 days and analyzed for the presence
of Annexin V-positive cells and debris using IncuCyte S3
(Essen Bioscience, Welwyn Garden City, UK).

On the following day, control and PME-1 KO PC-3
cells were seeded on the 6-well plates and microscopy
slides at approximately 30% seeding density and sup-
plemented with DMSO (control) or 0.1–10 lM of
Cytochalasin D (Sigma, C8273-1MG) 3 h later. Cells
on the microscopy slides were ﬁxed after two-hour
treatment and processed into ﬂuorescence microscopy
samples as indicated below. The remaining cells were
lysed after 24 h and analyzed for the presence of
cleaved PARP by western blotting.

blocked with 0.3% Triton in 10% horse serum (Gibco)
for 15 min at room temperature. All samples were
incubated in primary antibodies (diluted in 10% horse

and the gel was left to polymerize for 1 h at room
temperature. After polymerization, the dish was ﬁlled
with PBS and the coverslip was carefully removed.
Hydrogels were made permissive for protein binding
by incubating them in 500 lL of Sulfo-SANPAH solu-

Activated gels were washed three times with PBS to
get rid of residual Sulfo-SANPAH. Alternatively, pre-
activated polyacrylamide hydrogels of variable stiffness
were ordered from Matrigen Life Technologies.
Thirty-ﬁve-millimeter glass bottom dishes (SV3510-
EC-0.5) were used for imaging and 6-well plates (SW6-
EC-0.5, SW6-EC-50) for growing cells for lysis. All
hydrogels were functionalized with bovine plasma
ﬁbronectin and collagen type I by incubating the
dishes in 5 lgmL
 1 of each protein for 1–2 h at
37 °C, or overnight at 4 °C, before use. For western
blot analysis of cells on hydrogels, 0.5 and 50 kPa
hydrogel-coated 6-well plates were immersed in cell
culture medium for 30 min and seeded with 300000
PME-1 or control siRNA-treated PC-3 cells per well.
The cells were grown on the gels for 24 h. Once the
cultures reached 80–90% conﬂuency, the cells were
washed once and scraped into cold PBS, spun down
and lysed in RIPA buffer as described above. For
immunoﬂuorescence
experiments, PC-3 cells were
seeded on 0.5 kPa hydrogel-coated glass bottom dishes
and grown for an additional 24 h before ﬁxing and
sample preparation.

Patients with high tumour PME-1 expression had
signiﬁcantly shorter time to secondary therapies after
primary treatment (i.e., relapse-free survival; Fig. 1B),
indicative of clinical relevance of PME-1 in human
PCa. Linked to the association between PTEN loss
and high PME-1 expression (Fig. S1A), we asked
whether patients with tumours defective for both
(PTEN
tumour
and PP2A) would present with a particularly aggres-
sive disease. Patients with PTENloss/PME-1high tumour
phenotype constituted a sub-cohort of approximately
8% of patients (Fig. 1C). PTENloss/PME-1high status
correlated with remarkably aggressive tumours, with
secondary-therapy free survival
about 40% 5-year
among the cohort
(Fig. 1D). Similarly, albeit
less
prominent co-operative effects were observed with
PME-1 overexpression and either AR (Fig. 1E) or
ERG expression (Fig. S1B).

These results reveal a clinical relevance of PME-1 in
PCa. Notably, they identify a very aggressive PCa sub-
population associated with concomitant inhibition of
PTEN and PP2A tumour suppressor phosphatases.

PME-1 protein expression and its clinicopathological
associations were evaluated in PCa tissue microarray
(TMA) material comprising 358 patients treated pri-
marily with radical prostatectomy in the Helsinki
University Hospital between 1983 and 1998. The clini-
cal cohort has previously been described in detail
[5,27] (see Table S1 for demographics). The speciﬁcity
of
immunohistochemical
(IHC) staining has been validated previously [32].
PME-1 expression was scored using a four-tier scale of
negative,
intermediate, and strong expression.
Each patient had one benign core and three cancerous
cores in the TMA. PME-1 expression was lower in
benign prostate compared with cancerous prostate in
most patients (Table S2). In the survival analysis, the
maximum values of cancer-related PME-1 scores out
of three cancerous cores in the TMA were used and
each patient was dichotomized as either low or high
(negative,
staining;
Fig. 1A). In the correlation analysis with clinical vari-
ables, strong PME-1 protein expression correlated with
higher grade group and advanced stage (Table 1). We
also correlated PME-1 status with previously assessed

indications

Acknowledging the clinical
for a link
between PME-1 and PTEN, we tested the impact of
PME-1 depletion on colony growth of two PTEN -
deﬁcient PCa cell lines, PC-3 (PTEN null) and DU-
145 (PTEN heterozygous). PME-1 silencing by two
independent siRNAs did not affect colony growth of
either of the cell lines in 2D adherent cell culture con-
ditions (Fig. 2A). However, PME-1 silencing decreased
anchorage-independent growth of both cell lines in soft
agar (Fig. 2B). The context-dependent role of PME-1
in supporting anchorage-independent growth, but
being redundant for cell growth in 2D adherent condi-
tions is fully consistent with the established require-
ment of PP2A inhibition for anchorage-independence
of transformed human cells [33].

To further assess whether PME-1 is particularly rele-
vant for survival under anchorage-independent condi-
tions, we evaluated apoptosis induction in control and
PME-1 siRNA-transfected PC-3 cells cultured either
on tissue culture plastic or low attachment plates. We
observed a strong synergy between PME-1 inhibition
(by two independent siRNA oligos) and low attach-
ment

measured by PARP cleavage (Fig. 3A). Similar PME-1
depletion-induced apoptosis in low-attachment condi-
tions was observed in both DU-145 cells and LNCaP,
a PTEN null, AR high PCa cell line (Fig. S1C,D). To
rule out the possibility of siRNA off-target effects, we
created PC-3 PME-1 knock-out (KO) cells (pool or
single-cell clone) by CRISPR/Cas9. These cells dis-
played dose-dependent apoptosis induction on PME-1
loss
from substrate
(Fig. 3B). The functional co-operation of PTEN and
PP2A was interrogated further in a genetically deﬁned
model system: PME-1 overexpression in PTEN/p53
KO mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs)
[26]. In
accordance with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 results,
overexpression of PME-1 in PTEN/p53 KO MEFs
prevented PARP cleavage upon 24 h incubation in
low-attachment conditions (Fig. 3C). The relative base-
line PME-1 protein expression levels across different
cell models are shown in Fig. S1E. Taken together,
these data indicate an important role of PME-1 in

supporting
PTEN-deﬁcient cells.

across

(i.e.

from their

surroundings

In addition to low-attachment conditions, culturing
cells on low-stiffness matrix mimics a situation where
cells are poorly able to transmit adhesion-dependent
signals
anchorage-
independent growth). Previously,
it was shown that
non-transformed cells succumb to anoikis-type cell
death when plated on soft substrates, whereas cancer
cells do not die under the same conditions [34,35]. To
test whether PME-1 expression contributes to apopto-
sis resistance of cancer cells on soft matrix, control
and PME-1 siRNA transfected PC-3 cells were plated
on low (0.5 kPa) or high (50 kPa) stiffness hydrogels
functionalized with ECM components (ﬁbronectin and
collagen I). Consistent with published results from
other cancer cells [34], control PC-3 cells showed only
a very small increase in PARP cleavage on soft sub-
strate after 24 h. However, PME-1 depletion sensitized
the cells to apoptosis induction selectively in low-
stiffness conditions (Fig. 3D). Integrin-mediated cell
adhesion to ECM ligands activates outside-in signaling
pathways to promote cell proliferation and viability
[18,20]. To test if the apoptosis of PME-1-depleted
cells scales with the degree of adhesion signaling, we
exposed siCtrl- and siPME-1 transfected cells to sur-
faces functionalized with increasing concentrations of
integrin ligand (ﬁbronectin-fragment FNIII(7–10)),
while non-speciﬁc interactions with the plastic surface
were prevented using an anti-fouling agent (Fig. S2A).
Consequently, cell adhesion to the surface was fully
dependent on the concentration of the integrin ligand
(Fig. S2B). Apoptosis (Annexin V signal) was highest
in PME-1-silenced cells with no available integrin
ligand (0%) and decreased proportionally with increas-
ing integrin-mediated adhesion, whereas control cells
were insensitive to lack of adhesion and showed
marked apoptosis only upon STS treatment, which
was included as a positive control (Fig. 3E,F and
Fig. S2C).

In summary, these results demonstrate the potential
of PME-1 overexpression in protecting PTEN-deﬁcient
PCa cells from anoikis.

3.3. PME-1 supports in vivo anoikis resistance
and survival of prostate cancer cells in circulation

To test the in vivo relevance of PME-1-mediated inhibi-
tion of PCa cell anoikis, we grew either
siCtrl-
or siPME-1-transfected PC-3 xenografts on chicken
embryo CAMs. Tumours formed by PME-1-depleted
cells were overall more translucent, suggesting decreased
tumour growth (Fig. 4A). In accordance with the

anoikis suppressing activity of PME-1, histological anal-
yses of the dissected tumours revealed increased apopto-
sis
in tumours derived from
siPME-1-transfected cells (Fig. 4B,C). Tumour suppres-
sion was further conﬁrmed by the reduced number of
Ki-67 positive cells in tumours derived from PME-1-
depleted PC-3 cells (Fig. 4B,C).

Anoikis resistance is crucial for tumour cell dissemi-
nation through circulation. To test whether high
PME-1 expression could also suppress PCa cell death
in circulation in vivo, we examined the survival of con-
trol and PME-1-depleted, ﬂuorescent PC-3 cells
microinjected into the common cardinal vein of zebra-
ﬁsh embryos [28]. Stereomicroscope imaging and quan-
tiﬁcation indicated that control cells were detected
more frequently in the vasculature after 24 h com-
pared with the PME-1-silenced cells
(Fig. 4D,E),
demonstrating that PME-1 supported survival of circu-
lating PC-3 cells. These results are indicative of PME-
1-mediated anoikis resistance of PCa cells in vivo.

3.4. The potential mechanisms behind
PME-1-mediated anoikis resistance

A recent phosphoproteome study identiﬁed 185 PME-
1-regulated phosphopeptides in 128 proteins [36], indi-
cating PME-1-mediated control of multiple cellular
pathways and regulatory programs in cancer cells.
Thereby,
the anoikis sensitivity of PME-1-depleted
cells is expected to be governed by several different

mechanisms. To identify any such putative target
mechanism, we chose to interrogate the impact of
PME-1 on mechanisms acknowledged to be involved
in anoikis regulation [37,38].

Related to the established role of focal adhesion
kinase (FAK) signaling downstream of integrins in
anoikis suppression [39], we performed an immunoﬂu-
orescence analysis of phosphorylated FAK in control
and PME-1-silenced cells that were grown on soft
(0.5 kPa) hydrogels for 24 h. Even in low-attachment
conditions, endosomal FAK signaling can suppress
anoikis and promote cell viability [18]. However,
PME-1 silencing did not affect the overall p-FAK
levels or existence of cytoplasmic p-FAK foci in these
same culture conditions which resulted in anoikis sen-
sitization in PC-3 cells (Figs 5A,B and 3D). Next, we
analyzed the effects of PME-1 silencing on the phos-
phorylation of pro-survival kinase AKT and oncopro-
tein MYC
by
immunohistochemistry analysis of CAM tumours.
However, no inhibition on either of these oncogenic
and prosurvival signaling mechanisms were observed
upon PME-1 inhibition in either PC-3 or DU-145 cells
(Fig. S3A–C). An additional candidate mechanism that
could contribute to anoikis in PME-1-depleted cells
was actin cytoskeleton remodeling upon cell rounding
in low-attachment conditions [37,40]. To directly test
whether disruption of the actin cytoskeleton would
synergize with PME-1 inhibition to induce apoptosis,
control (n.t. gRNA) and PME-1 KO (PME-1 gRNA)

cells were treated with increasing concentrations of
cytochalasin D that prevents actin polymerization
(Fig. 5B). However, western blotting analysis after
24 h of treatment with cytochalasin D did not show a
PME-1-dependent difference in PARP cleavage, indi-
cating that cell rounding and actin disruption are not
causative mechanisms for inducing anoikis in PME-1-
depleted cells (Fig. 5C).

To identify additional candidate mechanisms linked
to PME-1-related anoikis regulation, we surveyed the
most enriched cellular processes impacted by PME-1
depletion based on the phosphoproteome data [36].
Interestingly, nuclear envelope assembly and chromatin
remodeling were the two most signiﬁcantly PME-1-
regulated cellular processes (Table S3). Notably, PME-
1 physically associates with the nuclear lamina (NL)
([41] and Fig. S4A,B) and regulates not only phospho-
rylation of lamins, key structural components of the
NL, but also other related proteins such as LAP2A/B

that connect the NL to chromatin (Fig. S4C). We con-
ﬁrmed that nuclear lamins are increasingly dephospho-
rylated (detected with Lamin-A/C phospho-antibody)
upon PME-1 depletion (Fig. S4D,E) and that this effect
is dependent on the PP2A complex B-subunit PPP2R2A
(Fig. S4D,E), an established tumour suppressor in PCa
[6,8]. Furthermore, NL directly inﬂuences chromatin
architecture [42,43], and NL de-regulation can lead to
DNA damage and cell death, limiting both cancer cell
growth in soft agar and metastasis [42,44,45]. There-
fore, we next assessed whether PME-1 inhibition could
alter nuclear structure and stability. To this end,
nuclear deformability of control and PME-1 KO cells
was measured by subjecting them to a microﬂuidic
micropipette
as previously
described [46]. Notably, PME-1 KO cells had signiﬁ-
cantly more deformable nuclei, implying structural dif-
ferences (Fig. 5D,E). We then assessed whether these
changes in nuclear mechanics would correlate with an

increase in the number of harmful nuclear envelope rup-
tures
this, we
employed transient expression of GFP-tagged nuclear
localization signal (NLS), and mCherry-tagged cyclic
GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic DNA sensor
[30]. Surprisingly, PC-3 cultures in low stiffness condi-
tions displayed fewer cells with GFP-positive cytoplasm
and less cytoplasmic cGAS foci,
indicative of fewer
compromised nuclear envelopes, upon PME-1 silencing
(Fig. 5F,G and Fig. S5A–C). Together these results
indicate that regardless of the newly identiﬁed role for

PME-1 in regulating NL proteins (Fig. S4C) and
nuclear mechanics (Fig. 5D,E), the anoikis sensitivity of
PME-1-depleted PC-3 cells cannot be explained directly
by apoptosis-inducing nuclear envelope disruptions.

However, PME-1-mediated alterations in different
NL proteins (Fig. S4C) could also impact cell viability
indirectly, by regulating chromatin structure and tran-
scription (Table S3). Chromatin condensation is depen-
dent on intact NL, and heterochromatin structures are
linked to the lamina via trimethylated histone H3
(H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) [43,47,48]. On the other

hand, increased H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 levels sensi-
tize cancer cells to apoptosis [22,23,49]. Thus, we studied
whether PME-1 depletion would affect H3K9me3 and
H3K27me3 levels in PC-3 cells grown on soft hydrogels.
Indeed, PME-1 depletion was found to increase both
H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 levels on soft substrate, con-
cordant with the increased apoptosis observed in similar
conditions (Figs 5H,I and 3D). However, consistent

with great heterogeneity in PCa and our model that
PME-1-mediated phosphoproteome regulation can con-
trol different anoikis sensitivity mechanisms, we did not
see evidence for increased histone 3 trimethylation in
DU-145 cells upon PME-1 depletion on soft substrate
(data not shown). Thereby, an increase in histone H3
methylation, and its subsequent apoptosis promoting
effects [22,23,49], may contribute to the increased

anoikis sensitivity in some PME-1-depleted PCa cells,
whereas in others alternative mechanisms are at play.
However, the direct mechanistic link between PME-1
and histone H3 methylation remains to be identiﬁed.

4. Discussion

the

that

indicate

Here, we discover a clinically relevant role for the
PP2A methylesterase PME-1 in supporting anchorage-
independent growth of PCa cells with compromised
PTEN. Our data
anchorage-
independence of PCa cells with concomitant inhibition
of the two tumour suppressor phosphatases, PP2A
and PTEN [3,9], can largely be explained by their
resistance to anoikis. Although anoikis suppression is
a generally relevant mechanisms for tumour progres-
sion [15,37], it may be of particular clinical importance
in slowly progressing cancers such as PCa, where
tumours can be diagnosed in the indolent phase, and
there is a strong need to be able to both predict and
inhibit the likelihood of disease progression [2].

anoikis-related mechanisms

Integrins act as key survival signaling receptors sup-
pressing anoikis [19]. Here, we demonstrate that the
onset of anoikis in PCa requires concomitant loss of
both integrin-mediated matrix rigidity-dependent sig-
naling and PME-1-mediated PP2A inhibition. Given
the complexity of both signaling programs, the con-
tributing molecular mechanisms are expected to be
numerous, impeding the identiﬁcation of a single key
mechanism. Nevertheless, we could exclude several
classical
from being
involved in the increased anoikis sensitivity of PME-1-
inhibited PCa cells with relative conﬁdence. On the
other hand, our results demonstrating a signiﬁcant
increase in apoptosis-promoting H3K9 and H3K27
trimethylation [22,23,49] at least in PC-3 cells do pro-
vide an interesting clue for the underlying mechanism
relevant in some PCa cells. Although the direct mecha-
nistic link between PME-1 and histone H3 methylation
remains to be addressed in future studies, both the
phoshoproteome data and increased nuclear deforma-
bility suggest that it could be attributed to abnormal
NL-chromatin mechanics in the PME-1-deﬁcient PCa
cells. The abnormal NL-chromatin mechanics could
also lead to other anoikis sensitizing changes beside
histone 3 trimethylation,
in other PME-1 depletion
sensitive PCa cells. Collectively our results demonstrate
a role for PME-1-mediated PP2A inhibition in protect-
ing several PTEN-deﬁcient cell models from anoikis
through divergent downstream mechanisms.

PTEN and PP2A have both been identiﬁed

co-operation has not been studied thus far. PTEN deﬁ-
ciency promotes anoikis resistance of PCa cells [50]
and our data indicate that concomitant inhibition of a
second tumour
suppressor phosphatase PP2A by
PME-1 renders the PTEN-deﬁcient cells particularly
well protected from anoikis. We hypothesize that this
is likely to contribute to the observed clinical aggres-
siveness of
these cancers. Mechanistically, PTEN-
mediated anoikis resistance is mediated by AKT sig-
naling [50,51], whereas we observed that PME-1 deple-
tion had no consistent effect on AKT phosphorylation
(Fig. S3A,B). This indicates non-overlapping down-
stream mechanisms for PTEN and PME-1 in anoikis
suppression, further explaining their synergetic actions.
As PTEN genetic status can be routinely evaluated in
current clinical PCa diagnostic practice [2], our results
indicate a diagnostic utility of assessment of PME-1
status for patients with complete PTEN loss. Deﬁni-
tion of PME-1 protein expression as a surrogate for
PP2A activity status in tissues samples would greatly
simplify biomarker analysis of PP2A function because
it sidesteps the need for analyzing all the possibly rele-
vant subunits. Moreover, as PME-1 inhibits directly
PP2A-C catalytic activity, in addition to regulating its
C-terminal tail methylation [10,14], analysis of PME-1
expression could be a superior diagnostic method over
detection of the methylation status of the PP2A-C by
modiﬁcation sensitive antibodies. Although further
studies are clearly needed to validate these conclusions,
our results indicate that patients with PTENloss/PME-

follow-up, and/or from more aggressive therapies as

Together these results identify anoikis resistance as a
candidate mechanism by which PME-1-mediated
PP2A inhibition promotes malignant progression of
PTEN-deﬁcient PCa. Together with emerging orally
bioavailable PP2A reactivating compounds, exhibiting
profound antitumour activity in in vivo PCa models
[52], these results clearly emphasize the future impor-
tance of comprehensive understanding of PP2A biol-
ogy for management of aggressive PCa. Future studies
would also be needed to validate whether the func-
tional co-operation of PTEN and PP2A extends to
other cancers beyond PCa, and whether these ﬁndings
would open novel therapeutic opportunities for simul-
taneously targeting both of these tumour suppressor
phosphatases [53].

phatases, but

Co-inhibition of PTEN and PP2A in prostate cancer

co-operation has not been studied thus far. These
results demonstrate that concomitant loss of activity
of PTEN and PP2A is associated with particularly
aggressive PCa phenotype and with early patient
relapse from standard therapy. In preclinical cell and
animal models double PTEN-PP2A inhibition potently
suppressed anoikis-type apoptosis
induction. PP2A
inhibition in these models was mediated by overexpres-
sion of
its methylesterase PME-1 which, based on
these results could constitute a potential biomarker for
evaluating aggressivity of PCas with PTEN loss.
Future research is however needed to fully understand
how PME-1 overexpression mechanistically leads to
anoikis resistance in PTEN-deﬁcient PCa cells.
