Control animals had approximately symmetrical horizontal projections toward C- and E-row columns in both supra- and infragranular layers. Following DE-pairing, the density of axons in supragranular layers projecting from the labeled neurons in the D2 column was higher in E- than in C-row columns. This asymmetry resulted primarily from a reduction in projection density toward the deprived C-row columns. In contrast, no change was observed in infragranular layers. The results indicate that DE-pairing during early postnatal development results in reduced axonal projection from nondeprived into deprived columns and that cortical neurons are capable of structural rearrangements at subsets of their axonal arbors.']",[],Not applicable 19

We report that sustained overexpression of H1aV impaired spatial working but not reference memory. Most notably, a similar impairment was observed when H1aV expression was restricted to the dorsal hippocampus (HP), which identifies this structure as the principal cortical area for spatial working memory. Interestingly, H1aV overexpression also abolished maintenance of CA3-CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP).

Yet in natural conditions chemical signals will frequently undergo concentration changes that produce differences in both level and pattern of activation of olfactory receptor neurons.

To signal species identity for mate recognition, some insects use the ratio of two components in a binary chemical mixture to produce a code that is invariant to dilution. Here, using psychophysical methods, we show that rats also classify binary odor mixtures according to the molar ratios of their components, spontaneously generalizing over at least a tenfold concentration range. These results indicate that extracting chemical ratio information is not restricted to pheromone signaling and suggest a general solution for concentration-invariant odor recognition by the mammalian olfactory system.']",[],Not applicable 21

Additional data file 1 provides a comparison between the program based on two binary classifiers and that based on one binary classifier and a comparison between the program using 0.35 as threshold to define CpG-related or non-CpG-related promoters and that using 0.3 as threshold. We assign promoter sequences as non-CpG related if the normalized CpG content of the 3 kb centered at the TSS is less than 0.3 and as CpG related otherwise. (Normalized CpG content was computed as in [13]: fCG/eCG where fCG is observed CG frequency eCG is the expected frequency calculated as [(fC + fG)/2]2 and fC and fG are the frequencies of C and G respectively.) This working definition is based on the observation that the CpG content follows a bimodal distribution which naturally separates the promoters into two classes [1113]. Saxonov and coworkers [13] used 0.35 as a threshold to define CpG-related or non-CpG-related promoters. Better classification results are produced when we are more strict in defining non-CpG-related promoters. (Additional data file 1 gives detailed comparisons between the program using 0.35 as the threshold and the program using 0.3 as the threshold.)To build any promoter model one needs a collection of promoter sequences with high-quality annotation. We used the annotations from the EPD (version 79) [33] and the DBTSS (version 3.0) [2]. (EPD is based on experimentally determined TSSs and DBTSS on full-length oligo-capped cDNA sequences.) EPD generally has better quality annotation than DBTSS but because there are only 299 non-CpG-related promoters from EPD we also included 1271 DBTSS-annotated promoters for training. After removing redundancy we had 1445 CpG-related promoters from EPD and 1570 non-CpG-related promoters combining both EPD and DBTSS promoters. The promoter sequences 250 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream of the TSS were extracted as the positive training set. The four (two upstream and two downstream) nonoverlapping consecutive segments immediately upstream and downstream of the positive set were used as our negative training set.In the fivefold cross-validation study for non-CpG-related promoters the set of 299 non-CpG-related promoters from EPD and four-fifths of 1271 promoters from DBTSS was used to train a model and the remaining set of one-fifth of the sequences of 2.4 kb each centered at the DBTSS-annotated TSS was used as test data.For comparison we also applied different programs to the sequences extracted from the genome-wide mapping data of promoters obtained from the ChIP-chip technology [4]. Testing the trained model on a separate dataset is important to achieve an unbiased evaluation. Therefore we kept those sequences 2.4 kb centered at the probes where there was only one DBTSS annotation and no more than one probe in the same sequence. This left us with 85 non-CpG-related and 1765 CpG-related test sequences of 2.4 kb each.From CSHL Mammalian Promoter Database (CSHLmpd) [34] we defined the tissue-specific activity of each human promoter based on the tissue information of mRNAs and expressed sequence tags overlapping promoters at the 5' end. We found most housekeeping gene promoters to be CpG related as expected whereas promoters active in only a few tissues are more likely to be non-CpG related consistent with previous reports [2635]. Among 636 so-called tissue-specific non-CpG-related promoters 84 are muscle specific. We applied leave-one-out cross-validation to this set of 84 promoters.

In this study we undertook a search for potential rabies virus (RV) M protein's cellular partners. In a yeast two-hybrid screen the eIF3h subunit was identified as an M-interacting cellular factor, and the interaction was validated by co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance assays.

Point mutations leading to cryptic 5′ss activation were most common in the first intron nucleotide, followed by the fifth nucleotide.

Discrimination of intronic 5′ss from their authentic counterparts was less effective than for exonic sites, as the former were intrinsically stronger than the latter.

To quantify the relative contributions of these different subpopulations in the awake preparation, we have estimated the representation of sounds across the neuronal population using a representative ensemble of stimuli. We used cell-attached recording with a glass electrode, a method for which single-unit isolation does not depend on neuronal activity, to quantify the fraction of neurons engaged by acoustic stimuli (tones, frequency modulated sweeps, white-noise bursts, and natural stimuli) in the primary auditory cortex of awake head-fixed rats.

However, previous scans have been limited in power and accuracy owing to small numbers of available genomes. Here we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new lineage- and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of ∼16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR<0.05), according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. As in previous studies, the identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible “selection histories” of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. A detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.', 'Populations evolve as mutations arise in individual organisms and, through hereditary transmission, gradually become “fixed” (shared by all individuals) in the population. Many mutations have essentially no effect on organismal fitness and can become fixed only by the stochastic process of neutral drift. However, some mutations produce a selective advantage that boosts their chances of reaching fixation. Genes in which new mutations tend to be beneficial, rather than neutral or deleterious, tend to evolve rapidly and are said to be under positive selection. Genes involved in immunity and defense are a well-known example; rapid evolution in these genes presumably occurs because new mutations help organisms to prevail in evolutionary “arms races” with pathogens. Many mammalian genes show evidence of positive selection, but open questions remain about the overall impact of positive selection in mammals. For example, which key differences between species can be attributed to positive selection? How have patterns of selection changed across the mammalian phylogeny? What are the effects of population size and gene expression patterns on positive selection? Here we attempt to shed light on these and other questions in a comprehensive study of ∼16,500 genes in six mammalian genomes.']",[],Not applicable 59

This phenotype has been associated with the absence of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the peripheral blood of Id1 mutant mice. However, the manner in which Id1 loss in the BM controls EPC generation or mobilization is largely unknown. Using genetically modified mouse models we demonstrate here that the generation of EPCs in the BM depends on the ability of Id1 to restrain the expression of its target gene p21. Through a series of cellular and functional studies we show that the increased myeloid commitment of BM stem cells and the absence of EPCs in Id1 knockout mice are associated with elevated p21 expression. Genetic ablation of p21 rescues the EPC population in the Id1 null animals, re-establishing functional BM-derived angiogenesis and restoring normal tumor growth. These results demonstrate that the restraint of p21 expression by Id1 is one key element of its activity in facilitating the generation of EPCs in the BM and highlight the critical role these cells play in tumor angiogenesis.']",[],Not applicable 68

Temporal structure on the millisecond timescale is normally captured using a short time Fourier analysis, and structure on the second timescale using song spectrograms. Here we use the dynamic spectrum on time series of song features to study the development of rhythm in juvenile zebra finch.

This probably reflects the ability of Vpx to overcome an as yet uncharacterized block to an early event in the virus life cycle in these cells, but the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Using biochemical and proteomic approaches, we have found that Vpx protein of the pathogenic SIVmac 239 strain associates with a ternary protein complex comprising DDB1 and VprBP subunits of Cullin 4–based E3 ubiquitin ligase, and DDA1, which has been implicated in the regulation of E3 catalytic activity, and that Vpx participates in the Cullin 4 E3 complex comprising VprBP. We further demonstrate that the ability of SIVmac as well as HIV-2 Vpx to interact with VprBP and its associated Cullin 4 complex is required for efficient reverse transcription of SIVmac RNA genome in primary macrophages. Strikingly, macrophages in which VprBP levels are depleted by RNA interference resist SIVmac infection. Thus, our observations reveal that Vpx interacts with both catalytic and regulatory components of the ubiquitin proteasome system and demonstrate that these interactions are critical for Vpx ability to enable efficient SIVmac replication in primary macrophages. Furthermore, they identify VprBP/DCAF1 substrate receptor for Cullin 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase and its associated protein complex as immediate downstream effector of Vpx for this function.

In this study we characterize how the replication of SIVmac is blocked in the absence of Vpx and how Vpx overcomes this block. We find that Vpx is required for efficient reverse transcription of the incoming RNA genome, suggesting that Vpx acts early following virion entry into the macrophage, probably on events linked to virion uncoating and/or reverse transcription.
