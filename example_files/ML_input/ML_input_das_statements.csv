A total of 630 spliceosomal and splicing-related proteins were collected from the Spliceosome DB [42] KEGG [43] and other literature references [1 23] (Additional file 2: Table S1A). This compendium comprises functionally confirmed spliceosomal proteins but also proteins related to other RNA-maturation processes such as mRNA surveillance export capping and polyadenylation. We included the latter proteins because they typically co-purify with the spliceosome [1 23] and are functionally associated or coupled with splicing [7 8 44]. Throughout the manuscript we consider this extended set of proteins as ‚Äòspliceosomal proteins‚Äô. A total of 37231 PPIs formed by these proteins were extracted from HPRD [25] and Hegele et al. [23]. In total 31363 co-expression profiles between mRNAs coding for these proteins and PPI partners were collected from the Human U133A/GNF1H microarray dataset [45] (Additional file 2: Table S1B).,1

The R/Bioconductor package rnaseqcomp is available under open source license GPL-3. A key aspect of our proposed assessment is the availability of two datasets that permit the computation of the metrics. They are characterized by including two populations at least two replicates for each population and a way to define beforehand which genes or transcripts are differentially expressed and which are not. The replicates permit the assessment of precision and comparing the two populations permits the assessment of sensitivity or the ability to discover real biological differences. Note that sensitivity is harder to assess because we need to know beforehand what differences to expect. In the past this has been achieved with spike-in experiments [18‚Äì20]. However the use of spike-ins has been criticized for not properly mimicking real experimental data [21].The first represents the minimal dataset that can be used for the comparison. It includes two replicates for the cell lines GM12878 and K562. We used results from a microarray experiment comparing the same two cell lines to define real biological differences. We defined genes with a q-value smaller than 0.05 [22 23] and absolute log fold changes larger than 1 as truly differentially expressed. Genes with q-values larger than 0.5 were denoted as not differentially expressed. Genes in neither of these two groups were considered to be in a ‚Äúgrey area‚Äù and left out of the analysis. Note that we are not considering microarrays to be a gold standard but because the microarray data represents an independent measurement algorithms that perform better at detecting real differences should on average show improved agreement with these independent results.The second dataset was created using 30 samples from the Geuvadis project [24]. These samples were selected to represent a random sample of individuals. To introduce batch effect-like variability we selected 15 from one center and 15 from another. These were then randomly divided into two groups both having seven samples from one center and eight from another. Because the samples were assigned at random this is a null experiment and we can consider the 15 samples in each group to be replicates. To distinguish the two groups we used computer simulations to generate 2424 transcripts designed to be differentially expressed between the two groups. To make these abundances mimic experimental data we adapted the Polyester method [25] to include GC bias imitating the bias observed in the actual data. The resulting dataset mimics a real one quite well (Fig.¬†1).Fig. 1Estimated log fold changes stratified by transcript abundance on simulation dataset. One example based on Cufflinks quantification of two samples is shown here. Black points are non-differential transcripts; blue points are differentially expressed transcripts which were simulated to have signals on both samples; red points are differentially expressed transcripts which were simulated to have signals in only one of the samplesThe raw sequencing files for both datasets are available from the webtool (http://rafalab.rc.fas.harvard.edu/rnaseqbenchmark).

Project name Chi8.Project home pagehttp://www.cs.njit.edu/usman/Chi8.Operating system Linux (tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2).Programming language C and CUDA (version 4.2 or greater). The latter is the NVIDIA language for their GPUs. For C we used gcc version 4.4.6 (Red Hat 4.4.6-3).License Please contact authors for commercial use. Academic use is free. Our real data is available directly by request from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and the National Institute of Health database of genotypes and phenotypes. The data access agreements prohibit us from posting this data publicly. The simulated data is freely available from the BOOST website http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/BOOST.html and the Chi8 source code from http://www.cs.njit.edu/usman/Chi8. We consider genome-wide association studies for seven diseases from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). We followed standard protocols for cleaning the data [17]. We removed SNPs that deviated significantly from the Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium and SNPs with greater than 1¬†% missing entries (Table 1).We also study publicly available simulated datasets used in the BOOST study [14]. These are four models each with a total of 800 and 1600 cases and controls (equal proportion) and mean allele frequencies of 0.1 0.2 and 0.4. Under each setting there are 100 simulated datasets each containing 1000 SNPs where the first and last are interacting and also have main effects. In brief Model 1 is a multiplicative model Model 2 is an epistasis model used to describe handedness and the color of swine Model 3 is the classical epistasis model and Model 4 is the popular exclusive OR (XOR) model. More details about the models and their simulation can be found in the BOOST study [14]. We downloaded these datasets from the BOOST website http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/BOOST.html.,1

The gene set analysis software was compared using three datasets including two large studies and one small one.The two large studies included a lung cancer set was provided with GSEA-R package [49] and a type 2 diabetes dataset comes from ChipperDB [51]. These datasets were chosen because they were originally used to validate and/or compare GSEA [34] and PAGE [5]The small dataset is a gene expression study from our group describing human MSC response to 8 hours of exposure to the signaling molecule BMP6. This dataset includes two experimental groups each with paired treatment and control samples resulting in a total of 4 gene chips. We have deposited the dataset into Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (accession number GSE13604). For the use in this paper the raw data were processed by using RMA implemented in the Bioconductor Affy package [52] with up-to-date probe set definition (.CDF file) based on Entrez Gene sequence Hs133P_Hs_ENTREZG_8 [53]. Annotation data were retrieved from the GAIQ website [48]. The type 2 diabetes dataset was processed similarly from raw data files.,1

In accordance with the data access policies of the ICGC and TCGA projects most molecular clinical and specimen data are in an open tier which does not require access approval. To access potentially identifying information such as germline alleles and underlying read data researchers will need to apply to the TCGA Data Access Committee (DAC) via dbGaP (https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login) for access to the TCGA portion of the dataset and to the ICGC Data Access Compliance Office (DACO; http://icgc.org/daco) for the ICGC portion. In addition to access somatic single nucleotide variants derived from TCGA donors researchers will also need to obtain dbGaP authorization. Beyond the core sequence data and variant call-sets the analyses in this paper used a number of datasets that were derived from the variant calls (Supplementary Table 4). The individual datasets are available at Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/) and are denoted with synXXXXX accession numbers; all these datasets are also mirrored at https://dcc.icgc.org with full links filenames accession numbers and descriptions detailed in Supplementary Table 4.

We assign promoter sequences as non-CpG related if the normalized CpG content of the 3 kb centered at the TSS is less than 0.3 and as CpG related otherwise. (Normalized CpG content was computed as in [13]: fCG/eCG where fCG is observed CG frequency eCG is the expected frequency calculated as [(fC + fG)/2]2 and fC and fG are the frequencies of C and G respectively.) This working definition is based on the observation that the CpG content follows a bimodal distribution which naturally separates the promoters into two classes [1113]. Saxonov and coworkers [13] used 0.35 as a threshold to define CpG-related or non-CpG-related promoters. Better classification results are produced when we are more strict in defining non-CpG-related promoters. (Additional data file 1 gives detailed comparisons between the program using 0.35 as the threshold and the program using 0.3 as the threshold.)To build any promoter model one needs a collection of promoter sequences with high-quality annotation. We used the annotations from the EPD (version 79) [33] and the DBTSS (version 3.0) [2]. (EPD is based on experimentally determined TSSs and DBTSS on full-length oligo-capped cDNA sequences.) EPD generally has better quality annotation than DBTSS but because there are only 299 non-CpG-related promoters from EPD we also included 1271 DBTSS-annotated promoters for training. After removing redundancy we had 1445 CpG-related promoters from EPD and 1570 non-CpG-related promoters combining both EPD and DBTSS promoters. The promoter sequences 250 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream of the TSS were extracted as the positive training set. The four (two upstream and two downstream) nonoverlapping consecutive segments immediately upstream and downstream of the positive set were used as our negative training set.In the fivefold cross-validation study for non-CpG-related promoters the set of 299 non-CpG-related promoters from EPD and four-fifths of 1271 promoters from DBTSS was used to train a model and the remaining set of one-fifth of the sequences of 2.4 kb each centered at the DBTSS-annotated TSS was used as test data.For comparison we also applied different programs to the sequences extracted from the genome-wide mapping data of promoters obtained from the ChIP-chip technology [4]. Testing the trained model on a separate dataset is important to achieve an unbiased evaluation. Therefore we kept those sequences 2.4 kb centered at the probes where there was only one DBTSS annotation and no more than one probe in the same sequence. This left us with 85 non-CpG-related and 1765 CpG-related test sequences of 2.4 kb each.From CSHL Mammalian Promoter Database (CSHLmpd) [34] we defined the tissue-specific activity of each human promoter based on the tissue information of mRNAs and expressed sequence tags overlapping promoters at the 5' end. We found most housekeeping gene promoters to be CpG related as expected whereas promoters active in only a few tissues are more likely to be non-CpG related consistent with previous reports [2635]. Among 636 so-called tissue-specific non-CpG-related promoters 84 are muscle specific. We applied leave-one-out cross-validation to this set of 84 promoters. The following additional data are available with the online version of this article. Additional data file 1 provides a comparison between the program based on two binary classifiers and that based on one binary classifier and a comparison between the program using 0.35 as threshold to define CpG-related or non-CpG-related promoters and that using 0.3 as threshold.,1

AuPairWise is available in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/gillislab/aupairwise). STAR is available in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/). We perform all our assessments on publically available RNA-seq data. We used the GEUVADIS (11) dataset which consists of 462 lymphoblastoid cell line samples (LCLs) split between 246 female and 216 male. The GEUVADIS data set is available at the European Nucleotide Archive (accession no. ERP001942). For our meta-assessment of RNA-seq expression databases we downloaded data from three databases. First Gemma (all datasets available as of Nov 2016) a quality controlled database that used bowtie2 (12) for alignment and quantified with RSEM (13). A second database was ARCHS4 (14) (v1 downloaded January 2018) that uses kallisto (3). A final database was recount2 (v1 downloaded January 2018) (15) that used the Rail-RNA pipeline (16). We selected a subset of 57 experiments (Supplementary Table S2) totalling 3405 samples that were common among the three and that had at least 20 samples per experiment. We used MetaSRA (17) to obtain sample labels and metadata through their SQLite database [http://metasra.biostat.wisc.edu/download.html].,1

We cloned Esp3I/BsmBI-compatible annealed and phosphorylated oligos encoding sgRNAs into Esp3I/BsmBI-linearized pLRT2B pUSEPR or pUSEBR using high concentration T4 DNA ligase (NEB). A 5‚Äô G (to boost U6 transcriptional initiation) was added to sgRNAs that lacked it either by appending it to the 5‚Äô or by substituting the first nucleotide in the 5‚Äô position for a G. All sgRNA sequences used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.Other plasmidsThe GO (C&gt;G) reporter was cloned by modifying the GO reporter system as described in ref.3.

Antibodies used for western blot analyses were: Cas9 (CellSignaling #19526S) and Actin (Abcam #ab49900).Animal workAnimalsAll mouse experiments were approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Internal Animal Care and Use Committee under MSKCC IACUC protocol 11‚Äì06-018. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and food and water were provided ad libitum. Foxn1nu (Swiss nude) mice were purchased from Envigo. All mice used were 6 to 8 week-old females.Pancreatic orthotopic transplantsFor transplantation of PDEC cells into the pancreas of adult mice animals were anesthetized and a survival surgery was performed to expose the pancreas. Independent of genotype a total of 1√ó105 PDEC cells resuspended in 25 ŒºL of growth factor reduced Matrigel (354230; Corning) diluted 1:1 with cold OptiMEM (Gibco) were injected into the tail region of the pancreas of each mouse. Mice were monitored for tumor development over time by abdominal palpation and were euthanized upon developing overt disease and becoming moribund following disease monitoring guidelines of IACUC and the MSKCC Animal Facility.Genomic DNA isolationIsolation of gDNA from cellsGenomic DNA was extracted from cells using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Cell pellets were processed in parallel and resulting gDNA was resuspended in 100‚Äì200 ŒºL of 10 mM Tris-Cl; 0.5 mM EDTA; pH 9.0. Samples from corresponding replicates from MBES and HBES screens were pooled at the gDNA level measured using a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher) and normalized before performing sequencing deconvolution.Isolation of gDNA from tumor tissuesGenomic DNA was extracted from tissues using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Multiple tumor fragments or nodules were microdissected and either processed immediately by finely mincing the tissue and incubating overnight in a lysis buffer containing proteinase K and following the manufacturer protocol or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C until day of processing. Resulting gDNA was resuspended in 100‚Äì200 ŒºL of 10 mM Tris-Cl; 0.5 mM EDTA; pH 9.0 measured using a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher) and normalized before assessing genome editing at the relevant locus of interest using deep sequencing.AMINEsearch bioinformatic pipelineWe developed a genome editing design tool AMINEsearch (Annotated Mutation-Informed Nucleotide Editing sgRNA search) implemented in R to comprehensively build libraries of annotated gene editing reagents to model a user-defined set of mutations. This algorithm can be applied to any sequencing dataset that uses standard maf format files. For further description of the algorithm and analysis including the process of library design Off-target analysis and conservation of variant protein sequence between human and mouse please see Supplementary Note 1.HBES and MBES library designMSK-IMPACT sequencing data (n=21694 tumors) was used to design sgRNAs and sensors compatible with commonly used BE configurations incorporating Cas variants (SpCas9 Cas9-NG xCas9 and ScCas9) combined within the FNLS or F2X (expanded window) BE vector variants (Supplementary Table 2a‚Äìb). IMPACT-derived outputs of AMINEsearch (Supplementary Table 2ce) were used to compile unique sensor constructs to construct HBES (Supplementary Table 2d) and MBES libraries (Supplementary Table 2f) that target the human and mouse genome respectively. These libraries served as the basis for experimental validation and screening of base editing sensors which are available under the ‚ÄúSensor validated‚Äù tab of the BE-SCAN web portal (https://dowlab.shinyapps.io/BEscan/).AMINEsearch v2Modifications to the algorithm were made to increase functionality of the AMINEsearch algorithm. Specifically modifications were made to accommodate BE variants that edit outside the region complementary to the sgRNA (CDA-BE4). As the demands of running larger dataset grew we incorporated the capacity to run parallel execution on multiple cores or processors. The option to reverse the effects of mutations rather than model them given a list of pathogenic mutations as input was added. A known issue was addressed to handle multiple genotypes that converge on the same protein sequence substitution as independent mutations. Version 2 includes the ability to track expected variant protein sequence when modeling human mutations in the mouse genome (See Supplementary Note 1). Versions 1 and 2 of the algorithm can be accessed at https://github.com/Kastenhuber/AMINEsearch/tree/AMINEsearch_v1.0 and https://github.com/Kastenhuber/AMINEsearch/tree/AMINEsearch_v2.0 respectively and are generalizable to analyze new mutation datasets and/or new base editor configurations.Exploratory set of BE sensor predictionsWe applied the algorithm to the recently updated mutation dataset from the MSK-IMPACT platform6 containing 341736 total somatic cancer SNVs derived from targeted sequencing of 47550 tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. 17). This targeted sequencing panel captures the coding region of up to 580 genes. Candidates for base editing included 5542 unique SNVs classified as missense nonsense splice site or nonstop mutations which were observed greater than six or more times (&gt;0.01% frequency). We considered all combinations of 13 Cas9 orthologs and 11 deaminases yielding 143 possible base editor configurations (Supplementary Table 8). This includes configurations that have been extensively characterized as well as combinations of Cas9 orthologs and deaminases that have not yet been assembled and used experimentally. Collectively this exploratory set of sgRNA predictions provides a broad set of options to generate mutations in human and mouse (Supplementary Table 8). A searchable filterable interface for the exploratory predicted set of sgRNAs are available under the ‚ÄúSensor Design - Human‚Äù and ‚ÄúSensor Design - Mouse‚Äù tabs in the shiny app web portal alongside sensor validated sgRNAs in BE-SCAN (https://dowlab.shinyapps.io/BEscan/).Design and construction of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesBase editing sensor module designEach sensor module is composed of the following parts: 1) a 22nt long 5‚Äô adapter/priming site with a Esp3I restriction site; 2) a 20nt long 5‚Äô G-containing sgRNA; 3) a 93nt long improved SpCas9 sgRNA scaffold partially based on7; 4) an 11nt long sequence corresponding to the 5‚Äô flanking sequence of the endogenous target site; 5) the 23nt cognate target site; 6) a 7nt long sequence corresponding to the 3‚Äô flanking sequence of the endogenous target site; 7) and a 28nt long 3‚Äô adapter/priming site with a EcoRI restriction site. Thus oligos encoding individual sensor modules are 204nt long.Cloning of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesDue to longer-than-average oligo length early attempts at design and construction of sensor libraries showed unacceptable synthesis and assembly error rates where in some instances over half of the sensors before or after assembly into the backbone were found to harbor insertions deletions single nucleotide mutations and incorrect chimeric sgRNA-target site molecules (data not shown). Through extensive trial and error we found that assembling sensor libraries using Agilent‚Äôs High Fidelity oligo synthesis platform significantly mitigated these issues.All PAM sensor (APS) (1152 oligos white-listed) MBES (4686 oligos) and HBES (5855 oligos) libraries were cloned into the pLRT2B backbone1 as follows (all library oligos are in Supplementary Table 2). Briefly each oligo pool was amplified using forward and reverse primers that append Esp3I and EcoRI sites to the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô ends of the sensor insert purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and ligated into Esp3I-digested and dephosphorylated pLRT2B vector using high-concentration T4 DNA ligase (NEB) (all cloning and sequencing oligos are in Supplementary Table 9). To ensure maximum library recovery we set up n=24 parallel PCR reactions per pool. A minimum of 2.4 ug of ligated pLRT2B plasmid DNA per pool (corresponding to n=8 ligations) was electroporated into Endura electrocompetent cells (Lucigen) recovered for one hour at 37C plated across four 15cm LB-Carbenicillin plates (Teknova) and incubated at 37¬∞C for 16 hours. The total number of bacterial colonies per pool was quantified using serial dilution plates to ensure a library representation of &gt;10000X. The next morning bacterial colonies were scraped and briefly expanded for 4 hours at 37¬∞C in 500mL of LB-Carbenicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Plasmid Plus Maxi Kit (Qiagen). To assess sensor distribution and fidelity of assembly per pool we amplified the sensor region using primers that append Illumina sequencing adapters on the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô ends of the amplicon as well as a random nucleotide stagger and unique demultiplexing barcode on the 5‚Äô end (Supplementary Table 9). Library amplicons were size-selected on a 2.5% agarose gel purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument.Analysis of base editing activity using GO reporter systemBase editor expressing cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells/well in 12 well plates and transduced 24 hours later with a defined amount of GO reporter to achieve 20‚Äì50% transduction efficiency. Virus-containing media was replaced with complete media 24 hours post-transduction and cells were harvested for flow cytometry at 96 hours post-transduction. We used an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher). Cells were trypsinized with a 100 Œºl of 0.25% Trypsin+EDTA and resuspended in 300 Œºl of complete medium in a 96 well U bottom plate. Data was acquired at a flow rate of 500 Œºl/min and at least 10000 events from the single cell population gating were recorded.Screening and deconvolution of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesScreening of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesWe first screened the APS library in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing one of nine different base editors as well as either the Cas9 or Cas9-NG nucleases as cutting controls. APS screens were performed essentially as described below in detail. We then screened a total of five mouse and human base editor-expressing cell lines with either MBES or HBES libraries using the following approach. Human cell lines (MDA-MD-231 and PC9) were screened with MBES to minimize fitness differences between sensor modules due to endogenous targeting of genes that suppress cellular proliferation. Following the same rationale mouse cell lines (KPT1 NIH3T3 and PDECs) were screened with HBES. Each screen (including the APS set) was performed as follows. To ensure that most cells harbor a single sgRNA integration event we determined the volume of viral supernatant that would achieve an MOI between ~0.3‚Äì0.5 upon standard transduction of a population of base editor-expressing cells. All screens were performed in technical duplicate and each step of the screen ‚Äì from infection to sequencing ‚Äì was optimized to achieve a minimum representation of 1000X. For instance to ensure a representation of &gt;1000X for HBES libraries at the transduction step we spinfected a total of 24 million cells across two 12-well plates per technical replicate using the volume of viral supernatant that would achieve a 30% infection rate (~7.2 million transduced cells per technical replicate). 24 hours after infection cells from each corresponding replicate were pooled into a minimum of 2 √ó 150mm tissue culture dishes (Corning) and selected with Blasticidin S (Gibco) at an empirically-determined final concentration ranging from 5 Œºg/mL to 30 Œºg/mL depending on the cell line. Cells were cultured and kept under Blasticidin selection for seven days post-transduction. When needed cells were trypsinized and re-plated at a minimum of 6 million cells per replicate to ensure a minimum representation of 1000X. For PDEC screens cell representation per replicate was maintained at &gt;600X at all points. Subsequently at least 6 million cells were pelleted and stored at ‚àí20¬∞C. Genomic DNA (gDNA) from cells was isolated using the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer‚Äôs guidelines. Genomic DNA was harvested from all timepoints and both sensor BE activity and sgRNA abundance were assessed via NGS.Deconvolution of mouse and human base editing sensor screensWe assumed that each cell contains approximately 6.6 pg of gDNA. Therefore screen deconvolution at 1000X required sampling ~6 million √ó 6.6 pg of gDNA or ~39.6 ug. We employed a modified 2-step PCR version of the protocol published by Doench et al8 adapted to our unique library design. Briefly we performed an initial PCR whereby the integrated sensor cassettes were amplified from gDNA followed by a second PCR to append Illumina sequencing adapters on the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô ends of the amplicon as well as a random hexamer and unique demultiplexing barcode on the 5‚Äô end. Each ‚ÄúPCR1‚Äù reaction contained either 25 ŒºL of Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB) 2.5 ŒºL of Sensor_v6_Fwd Primer (10 ŒºM) 2.5 ŒºL of Sensor_v6_Rev Primer (10 ŒºM) and 5 Œºg of gDNA in 20 ŒºL of water (for a total volume of 50 ŒºL per reaction) or 10ŒºL of Herculase II 5X Master Mix (Agilent) 0.5 uL dNTPs 2.5 ŒºL of Sensor_v6_Fwd Primer (10 ŒºM) 2.5 ŒºL of Sensor_v6_Rev Primer (10 ŒºM) 1 uL of Herculase II polymerase and 5 Œºg of gDNA in 33.5 ŒºL of water (for a total volume of 50 ŒºL per reaction). The number of PCR1 reactions was scaled accordingly; therefore we performed eight PCR1 reactions per technical replicate and time point for all screens. PCR1 amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and used as template for ‚ÄúPCR2‚Äù reactions. Each PCR2 reaction contained either 25 ŒºL of NEBNext 2X Master Mix (NEB) 2.5 ŒºL of a uniquely barcoded PCR2_Fwd Primer (10 ŒºM) 2.5 ŒºL of a common PCR2_Rev Primer (10 ŒºM) and 300 ng of PCR1 product in 20 ŒºL of water (for a total volume of 50 ŒºL per reaction). We performed two PCR2 reactions per PCR1 product. Library amplicons were size-selected either on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) or using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) followed by normalization pooling and sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (150 nt paired-end reads). All primer sequences are available in Supplementary Table 6. PCR program for PCR1 using Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB) was: 1) 98¬∞C √ó 30s; 2) 98¬∞C √ó 10s; 3) 55¬∞C √ó 30s; 4) 72¬∞C √ó 30s; 5) Go to step 2 √ó 24 cycles; 6) 72¬∞C √ó 2 min; 7) 4¬∞C forever. When using Herculase II denaturation steps were done at 95¬∞C and the initial denaturation lasted for 2 minutes. PCR program for PCR2 using NEBNext 2X Master Mix (NEB) was: 1) 98¬∞C √ó 30s; 2) 98¬∞C √ó 10s; 3) 65¬∞C √ó 30s; 4) 72¬∞C √ó 30s; 5) Go to step 2 √ó 17 cycles; 6) 72¬∞C √ó 2 min; 7) 4¬∞C forever.Analysis of mouse and human base editing sensor screening dataTo quantify base editing outcomes raw paired-end FASTQ reads were paired using Pandaseq and merged FASTQ files were used as input for downstream analysis. We first removed reads with mutated sgRNAs or scaffolds or reads with non-matching sgRNA and target sequences (due to templates switching during PCR amplification). Next the 5‚Äô scaffold and linker were used to associate each sgRNA with the read; sgRNAs that did not match the whitelist were also discarded. All remaining reads were aligned to their cognate target found in the whitelist and aligned reads with no indels were considered for base editing analysis. Sensors that deviated from the expected length were flagged as indels and their actual frequency calculated as a specific insertion or deletion. Editing events were classified over all cytosines within a ‚àí5 to 20 position window of the target where 1 is defined as the first position of the protospacer. Target cytosine editing (tCTN tCGN tCAN) quantified the frequency of editing at the target cytosine regardless of editing at other adjacent cytosines. Target cytosine editing without collateral editing (tCT) was measured as specific C&gt;T editing without associated mutations at adjacent sites. Purity values were calculated as the ratio of tCT/tCTN. Custom code to perform the BE analysis is available at: https://github.com/schmidt73/base-editing-analysis. All data for APS HBES and MBES screens can be found in Supplementary Tables 1 4 and 5 respectively.Comparison of base editing sensor screening outcomes with BE-HiveTo consider the performance of the BE-Hive base-editing outcome prediction model in relation to our data we pulled the fully trained network from the Github repository linked by Arbab et. al9. This model is split into two parts: a component that predicts the probability of any edit occurring and another that predicts the probability of a specific base editing outcome conditioned on any editing occurring. These are referred to as the editing efficiency and bystander model respectively. Per instructions we fed in our input spacer and its 50-mer context to both models and computed the posterior probability of each observed outcome using the chain rule. One caveat is that the editing efficiency model directly predicts an un-transformed score not a probability. To convert this to a probability we sigmoid transformed it into the unit interval [0 1]. Following the recommendations provided in their README file we first linearly re-scaled the score using the mean and standard deviation of reads prior to sigmoid transforming it into a probability to account for variance in base editor expression by experimental condition and cell-type. We note that this is a monotonic operation; therefore it should not affect any SpearmanR correlations used to analyze performance.BE-Hive does not consider PAM sequence as a feature in their prediction mode. Given that the PAM is an important determinant of the activity of standard base editors we considered two different sets of sgRNAs in our comparisons. First we considered all sgRNAs used in our screen. Second we considered only the sgRNAs with canonical NGG PAMs.Phenotypic screens using base editing sensor librariesStable base editor-expressing KrasG12D/+; Trp53WT/WT pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs)5 were generated by lentiviral transduction with FNLS (Addgene #110841) and validated using GO3 (Addgene #136896). Phenotypic MBES screens in FNLS-PDECs were set up essentially as described above for HBES/MBES sensor screens with a few modifications. MBES FNLS-PDEC screens were performed across six independent transduction replicates in parallel. Each replicate was maintained at a minimum 500X representation at every step of the screen by replating 3 million cells per time point and pelleting the rest of the cells for gDNA isolation and screen deconvolution. Screens ran for approximately 36 cumulative population doublings across 34 days after which we isolated gDNA and proceeded to perform screen deconvolution essentially as described above for MBES/HBES screens.Proliferation screen analysisPaired-end reads were joined using Pandaseq. Merged reads were processed as described for BE analysis above. Total read counts for each replicate were used as input for MAGeCK10 11 analysis. Any sgRNA with read counts &lt; 100 were removed from analysis. Comparisons of T0 (day 5 post-transduction) versus T1 (day 14) and T2 (day 30 post-transduction) for each replicate were performed using MAGeCK to determine log fold changes. Base editing outcomes at the sensor target site were concurrently measured using the sensor screen pipeline described above.Validation experimentsFor validation of individual targets sgRNAs were cloned into the lentiviral guide expression vector LRT2B (Addgene #110854) and lentiviral particles were produced as described above. Base editor expressing cells were plated at a density of 25000 cells/well in 12 well plates and were infected 24-hours later with enough virus to achieve 50% transduction efficiency. Virus-containing media was replaced with complete media 24 hours post-transduction and cells were plated into selection media containing 3 Œºg/mL Blasticidin S (Gibco). Experimental cells remained in selection media until the final collection time point at 7 days post-transduction. Final LRT2B infection efficiency was determined by measuring the levels of tdTomato in 10% of the cells remaining at day 7 using flow cytometry. Genomic DNA was isolated using the protocol found on dowlab.org/protocols and targets were amplified using a 100 Œºl reaction following the standard NEB Taq 2x MM protocol with primers found in Supplementary Table 9. Each PCR was performed 3X/target and pooled. Amplicons were confirmed on a 2% agarose gel and PCR purified using QIAGEN QIAquick PCR purification kit. DNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop and samples were normalized to 20 ng/Œºl and sequenced using EZ-amplicon sequencing (MiSeq; 2 √ó 250bp) by GENEWIZ Inc (South Plainfield NJ USA).Analysis of deep sequencing data from validation experimentsCRISPResso212 was used to process sequencing reads from the validation experiments and the corresponding sensor sequencing results for each individual target. The data was analyzed on default CRISPResso2 base editor mode with the exception to the following parameters for endogenous locus results: -quantification_window_center ‚àí15 and sensor results: --quantification_window_size 10 --quantification_window_size 10 --base_editor_output --quantification_window_center ‚àí15 --exclude_bp_from_right 1 --plot_window_size 18. To calculate target C&gt;T editing and non-canonical editing we used the ‚ÄúAlleles_frequency_table_around_sgRNA.txt‚Äù file to get the read counts for a specific allele.Statistical analyses and Data VisualizationAnalysis and data visualization in RHeatmaps dotplots and correlation analyses (including correlation graphs) were performed in R version 3.6.3 and plots were produced using the ggplot2 and ggpubr package. Statistical considerations are reported in each figure legend.Analysis and data visualization in GraphPad PRISMAdditional bar plots survival curves and associated statistical analyses were generated using Prism 8 (GraphPad) and are indicated in figure legends. Error bars represent standard deviation unless otherwise noted. We used Student‚Äôs t-test (unpaired two-tailed) to assess significance between experimental and control groups and to calculate P values. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. The CNMF-E method was carried out using a custom Matlab algorithm (for a detailed description and availability of this method see33).Once the temporal activity of the neurons was extracted we characterized the CS (sound) or US (shock) responses of each neuron using auROC (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve) analysis in which we compared the average ŒîF value during the baseline period (2 s immediately prior to the delivery of CS or US) with that during CS or US presentations (2 s immediately after the onset of CS or US) in each trial by moving a criterion from zero to the maximum ŒîF value. We then plotted the probability that the ŒîF values during CS or US presentations was greater than the criteria against the probability that the baseline ŒîF values was greater than the criteria. The area under this curve quantifies the degree of overlap between the two ŒîF distributions (i.e. the discriminability of the two). A permutation test (iteration 5000 times) was used to determine whether the average ŒîF values during CS or US presentations were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than during baseline and thus classify a neuron as being CS- responsive or US-responsive respectively. The peak CS or US response amplitude in each trial was determined by searching the maximum value within a 3.75 or 5-s respectively time window immediately after stimulus onset.,1

The raw sequencing data used in this study are available from the respective publications listed in Supplementary Table 5. The alignments and structural variation calls produced in this study for NGMLR and Sniffles are available here: https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles. The source code documentation and test data sets are available at: https://github.com/philres/ngmlr and https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles for the mapping and SVs calling method respectively.Software Versions and Parameter settingsBWA-MEM (version 0.7.12-r1039) 26 was used with ‚Äú-M‚Äù parameter to map the short-reads and with ‚Äú-X pacbio -M‚Äù to follow the recommended parameter settings for PacBio reads. The parameter ‚ÄìM is used to mark only one alignment as primary and the subsequent alignments as secondary. BlasR (version 1.3.1)25 was run using the parameters ‚Äú-sam -bestn 1 -nproc 15‚Äù to obtain only the best alignment in SAM format using 15 threads. Furthermore Blasr was run with the parameters suggested by PBHoney 18 ‚Äú-nproc 15 -bestn 1 -sam -clipping subread -affineAlign -noSplitSubreads -nCandidates 20 -minPctIdentity 75 -sdpTupleSize 6‚Äù. SAMTools (version 0.1.19-44428cd) 47 was used to convert the SAM alignment files to BAM and to sort the aligned reads.Delly (version v0.7.3) 15 Lumpy (version 0.2.13) 14 and Manta (version 1.0.3) 16 were used to call SVs over the high mapping quality aligned Illumina reads (MQ20+) followed by SURVIVOR (version 0.0.1) 48 to combine the calls and report the consensus variants. To allow for the uncertainty with short-read variant positioning SVs were considered to be the same if their start and stop coordinates fell within 1kb of another and were of the same type. PBHoney (version PBSuite_15.8.24)18 with default parameters was used to infer SV based on the specified BlasR alignments. The output was converted into a VCF using SURVIVOR (option 10).More general information can be obtained from the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.,1

"A list of single amino acid substitutions annotated with the keyword ‚Äúdisease‚Äù was extracted from the UniProt/SwissProt database [77]. This manually curated catalog contains missense mutations associated with both Mendelian and complex diseases but no nonsense nor frame shift mutations and no products of alternative splicing.The initial set of mutations was filtered as follows: proteins that carry disease mutations and have ‚â•40% pairwise sequence identity were clustered using hierarchical clustering with single linkage and one representative protein was selected at random from each cluster. We further removed four proteins with an unusually high number of annotated disease mutations (Figure S8A): tumor suppressor p53 (P04637) coagulation factor VIII (P00451) androgen receptor (P10275) and Stargardt disease protein (P78363). Taken together these four proteins account for a total of 12.4% of all disease mutations found in the non-redundant set of proteins. All mutations from the removed proteins were discarded.We assembled two control datasets: (1) annotated single amino acid polymorphisms from UniProt (Poly) [77] and (2) a set of pseudo-mutations based on amino acid variation in mammalian orthologous proteins (neutral evolutionary substitutions NES). The first control dataset (Poly) was filtered analogously to disease mutations and redundant proteins and titin (with unusually high number of polymorphisms) were removed (Figure S8B).The second control dataset (NES) (Figure S8C) was constructed following the approach of Sunyaev et al.
[78]. Proteins that carry disease mutations which also passed our filtering criteria were aligned by the use of multiple sequence alignment program MUSCLE [79] against their InParanoid [80] orthologs from 10 mammalian species (P. troglodytes P. pygmaeus abelii M. musculus M. mulatta C. familiaris E. caballus R. norvegicus C. porcellus B. taurus and M. domestica) using the BLOSUM85 matrix. The set of neutral evolutionary substitutions (NES) was assembled from all single amino acid differences in orthologous proteins that had ‚â•95% sequence identity with the human disease protein. Finally all annotated disease mutations were filtered out from the NES dataset. The numbers of proteins and mutations in the three datasets are summarized in

To illustrate our analyses we used data from publically accessible RNA-seq experiments where we define an experiment as a set of samples. The majority of the work and analyses were performed using the following datasets: ENCODE (GSE35584) [34] Marioni et al (GSE11045) [21] Xu et al (GSE26109) [22] and BrainSpan [35]. The ENCODE dataset and the Marioni et al. dataset were downloaded from SRA and converted to fastq files using ‚Äúfastq-dump‚Äù from the SRA Toolkit [36]. Following quality control using the fastX tools we mapped the reads using bowtie2 [37] and estimated the RPKM and FPKM expression levels using RSEQtools [38] and Cufflinks [39] respectively and the GENCODE annotations file [17] (version 18). We used the processed data provided in the Xu et al. supplement and the online Brainspan data. For our assessment of publically available data we looked at those accessible both via Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA). We used the URL from the GEO browser [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/browse/?view=samples&amp;display=500&amp;type=10&amp;tax=9606&amp;sort=type] filtering on human samples and those in SRA as of January 2015. Of the resulting 39K samples we then filtered on samples only in a single experiments (unique to one GSE ID close to 1.4K experiments) and then calculated the sample size for each of these. For a final follow up we then obtained 83 RNA-seq experiments from the Gemma database [40] that were processed using RSEM [41]. These experiments varied in experimental design sample size read depth sample type and conditions. All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.

The BarDensr Python package is available from https://github.com/jacksonloper/bardensr. The NeuroCAAS implementation of BarDensr can be found at http://www.neurocaas.com/analysis/8. This NeuroCAAS implementation requires no software or hardware installation by the user. As input the user must upload a stack of images a codebook and a configuration file specifying parameters such as the radius of the smallest rolonies of interest (see S1 Appendix Section C as well as the NeuroCAAS link above for further details regarding the data format.) We assume that the images have been registered and background-subtracted before input into NeuroCAAS. There are three outputs from BarDensr NeuroCAAS implementation:The first output indicates candidate rolony locations. This output is represented in a comma-separated-value file listing all entries in the rolony density F which have signal greater than zero.The second output is designed to help the user assess the quality of the results; it is an HDF5 file which stores diagnostics about each detected rolony. See the next section for details.The third output is a plot designed to help the user assess the overall quality of the results. For each detected rolony we estimate the quality of evidence for that rolony by taking a key correlation coefficient (see the next section for details). The plot shows the histogram of these quality measures over all spots.For further details on the AWS hardware used in the NeuroCAAS implementation see S1 Appendix (Section D).
