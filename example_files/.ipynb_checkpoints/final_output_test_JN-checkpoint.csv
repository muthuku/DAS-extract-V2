Most currently used approaches utilize either bulk whole genome sequencing or single-cell DNA sequencing and are based on calling copy number alterations and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is commonly applied to explore differential gene expression of cancer cells throughout tumor progression. The method exacerbates the single-cell sequencing problem of low yield per cell with uneven expression levels. This accounts for low and uneven sequencing coverage and makes SNV detection and phylogenetic analysis challenging. In this article, we demonstrate for the first time that scRNA-seq data contain sufficient evolutionary signal and can also be utilized in phylogenetic analyses. We explore and compare results of such analyses based on both expression levels and SNVs called from scRNA-seq data. Both techniques are shown to be useful for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between cells, reflecting the clonal composition of a tumor. Both standardized expression values and SNVs appear to be equally capable of reconstructing a similar pattern of phylogenetic relationship. This pattern is stable even when phylogenetic uncertainty is taken in account. Our results open up a new direction of somatic phylogenetics based on scRNA-seq data.

Understanding this mapping is often challenging because of interactions between mutations, where the result of combining several different mutations can be very different than the sum of their individual effects. Here we provide a statistical framework for modeling complex genetic interactions of this type. The key idea is to ask how fast the effects of mutations change when introducing the same mutation in increasingly distant genetic backgrounds. We then propose a model for phenotypic prediction that takes into account this tendency for the effects of mutations to be more similar in nearby genetic backgrounds.', 'Contemporary high-throughput mutagenesis experiments are providing an increasingly detailed view of the complex patterns of genetic interaction that occur between multiple mutations within a single protein or regulatory element. By simultaneously measuring the effects of thousands of combinations of mutations, these experiments have revealed that the genotype–phenotype relationship typically reflects not only genetic interactions between pairs of sites but also higher-order interactions among larger numbers of sites. However, modeling and understanding these higher-order interactions remains challenging. Here we present a method for reconstructing sequence-to-function mappings from partially observed data that can accommodate all orders of genetic interaction. The main idea is to make predictions for unobserved genotypes that match the type and extent of epistasis found in the observed data. This information on the type and extent of epistasis can be extracted by considering how phenotypic correlations change as a function of mutational distance, which is equivalent to estimating the fraction of phenotypic variance due to each order of genetic interaction (additive, pairwise, three-way, etc.). Using these estimated variance components, we then define an empirical Bayes prior that in expectation matches the observed pattern of epistasis and reconstruct the genotype–phenotype mapping by conducting Gaussian process regression under this prior. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we present an application to the antibody-binding domain GB1 and also provide a detailed exploration of a dataset consisting of high-throughput measurements for the splicing efficiency of human pre-mRNA ', ' splice sites, for which we also validate our model predictions via additional low-throughput experiments.']",['https://github.com/davidmccandlish/vcregression'],3.0,1.0

"A list of single amino acid substitutions annotated with the keyword “disease” was extracted from the UniProt/SwissProt database [77].

We further removed four proteins with an unusually high number of annotated disease mutations (Figure S8A): tumor suppressor p53 (P04637) coagulation factor VIII (P00451) androgen receptor (P10275) and Stargardt disease protein (P78363). Taken together these four proteins account for a total of 12.4% of all disease mutations found in the non-redundant set of proteins. All mutations from the removed proteins were discarded.We assembled two control datasets: (1) annotated single amino acid polymorphisms from UniProt (Poly) [77] and (2) a set of pseudo-mutations based on amino acid variation in mammalian orthologous proteins (neutral evolutionary substitutions NES).

The majority of these predictors are based on protein structure and evolutionary conservation, following the assumption that disease mutations predominantly affect folded and conserved protein regions. However, the prevalence of the intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs) in the human proteome together with their lack of fixed structure and low sequence conservation raise a question about the impact of disease mutations in IDRs. Here, we investigate annotated missense disease mutations and show that 21.7% of them are located within such intrinsically disordered regions. We further demonstrate that 20% of disease mutations in IDRs cause local disorder-to-order transitions, which represents a 1.7–2.7 fold increase compared to annotated polymorphisms and neutral evolutionary substitutions, respectively.

Disease disorder-to-order mutations also influence predicted molecular recognition features (MoRFs) more often than the control mutations. The repertoire of disorder-to-order transition mutations is limited, with five most frequent mutations (R→W, R→C, E→K, R→H, R→Q) collectively accounting for 44% of all deleterious disorder-to-order transitions. As a proof of concept, we performed accelerated molecular dynamics simulations on a deleterious disorder-to-order transition mutation of tumor protein p63 and, in agreement with our predictions, observed an increased α-helical propensity of the region harboring the mutation. Our findings highlight the importance of mutations in IDRs and refine the traditional structure-centric view of disease mutations. The results of this study offer a new perspective on the role of mutations in disease, with implications for improving predictors of the functional impact of missense mutations.', 'Intrinsically unstructured or disordered proteins have been implicated in the etiology of a wide spectrum of diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms that relate mutations in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) to disease pathogenesis have not been investigated. Disordered proteins do not conform to the prevailing view of deleterious mutations which equates function, structure and evolutionary conservation – intrinsically disordered regions are functional, but lack a fixed three-dimensional structure and in general have low sequence conservation. Here we demonstrate that >20% of disease-associated missense mutations affect IDRs and interfere with their functions. We further show that 20% of deleterious mutations in IDRs induce predicted disorder-to-order transitions. Our predictions are supported by accelerated molecular dynamics simulations that show an increase in helical propensity of the region harboring a disease disorder-to-order transition mutation of tumor protein p63. Our results refine the traditional structure-centric view of disease mutations and offer a new perspective on the role of non-synonymous mutations in disease.

We measured sperm mosaicism using deep whole genome sequencing, both for variants present in an offspring and evident only in father’s sperm, and identified single nucleotide, structural, and short tandem repeat variants. We found that mosaicism quantification can stratify ASD recurrence risk due to DNMs into the vast majority with near 0% recurrence and a small fraction with a substantially higher and quantifiable risk, and we identify novel mosaic variants at risk for transmission to a future offspring.

The replicative helicase Mcm2-7 functions in both initiation and fork progression and thus is an important target of regulation. Mcm4, a helicase subunit, possesses an unstructured regulatory domain that mediates control from multiple kinase signaling pathways, including the Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK). Following replication stress in S phase, Dbf4 and Sld3, an initiation factor and essential target of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK), are targets of the checkpoint kinase Rad53 for inhibition of initiation from origins that have yet to be activated, so-called late origins. Here, whole-genome DNA replication profile analysis is used to access under various conditions the effect of mutations that alter the Mcm4 regulatory domain and the Rad53 targets, Sld3 and Dbf4. Late origin firing occurs under genotoxic stress when the controls on Mcm4, Sld3, and Dbf4 are simultaneously eliminated. The regulatory domain of Mcm4 plays an important role in the timing of late origin firing, both in an unperturbed S phase and in dNTP limitation. Furthermore, checkpoint control of Sld3 impacts fork progression under replication stress. This effect is parallel to the role of the Mcm4 regulatory domain in monitoring fork progression. Hypomorph mutations in ', ' are suppressed by a ', ' regulatory domain mutation. Thus, in response to cellular conditions, the functions executed by Sld3, Dbf4, and the regulatory domain of Mcm4 intersect to control origin firing and replication fork progression, thereby ensuring genome stability.']",[],3.0,24.0

Down-regulation of most of these targets is weak and has no detectable individual phenotypic effect. Whether this extensive weak repression is biologically relevant is a central issue in the debate on miRNA functionality. In the “small (target) pool” view, weak repression is nonfunctional and should be gradually removed during evolution. However, since the selective advantage of removing individual targets is small, testing this hypothesis is a challenge. We propose a novel approach by using miRNAs we call twin-miRs, which produce two mature products from the hairpin of the same miRNA precursor. Loss of the minor miR partner would affect all its targets and thus could be visible to selection. Since the minor miRs repress all their targets weakly, the “small pool” hypothesis would predict the elimination of twin-miRs over time. Surveying and sequencing 45 small RNA libraries in ', ', we found that nearly 40% of miRNAs produce twin-miRs. The minor forms are expressed in nontrivial abundance and repress their targets weakly. Interestingly, twin-miRs are often evolutionarily old, highly conserved, and comparable to solo-miRs in expression. Since there is no measurable trend toward reduction in target pool size, we conclude that at least some of the weak repression interactions are functional. A companion study using the May–Wigner theory of network stability suggests that distributed weak repression cumulatively contributes to stability of gene regulatory networks.']",[],3.0,7.0

Crucial to this success is the ability to motivate animals to perform specific behaviors. One successful strategy is to restrict their water intake, rewarding them with water during a behavioral task. However, water restriction requires rigorous monitoring of animals’ health and hydration status and can be challenging for some mice. We present an alternative that allows mice more control over their water intake: free home-cage access to water, made slightly sour by a small amount of citric acid (CA). In a previous study, rats with free access to CA water readily performed a behavioral task for water rewards, although completing fewer trials than under water restriction (', '). We here extend this approach to mice and confirm its robustness across multiple laboratories. Mice reduced their intake of CA water while maintaining healthy weights. Continuous home-cage access to CA water only subtly impacted their willingness to perform a decision-making task, in which they were rewarded with sweetened water. When free CA water was used instead of water restriction only on weekends, learning and decision-making behavior were unaffected. CA water is thus a promising alternative to water restriction, allowing animals more control over their water intake without interfering with behavioral performance.']",['https://github.com/int-brain-lab/citricAcid'],3.0,14.0

We then applied an admixture-aware method to identify 220 SVs exhibiting extreme patterns of frequency differentiation – a signature of local adaptation. The top two variants traced to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, tagging a haplotype that swept to near fixation in certain southeast Asian populations, but is rare in other global populations.

Our results indicate that B cells in good outcome tumors (no recurrence within 5 years) are spatially dispersed, while B cells in poor outcome tumors (recurrence within 3 years) are more confined. While most TILs are located within the stroma, increased numbers of spatially dispersed lymphocytes within cancer cell islands are associated with a good prognosis. B cells and T cells often form lymphocyte clusters (LCs) identified via density-based clustering. LCs consist either of T cells only or heterotypic mixtures of B and T cells. Pure B cell LCs were negligible in number. Compared to tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), LCs have fewer lymphocytes at lower densities. Both types of LCs are more abundant and more spatially dispersed in good outcomes compared to poor outcome tumors. Heterotypic LCs in good outcome tumors are smaller and more numerous compared to poor outcome.

One fundamental question is how best to compare neuron structures, for instance to organize and classify large collection of neurons. We aim to develop a flexible yet powerful framework to support comparison and classification of large collection of neuron structures efficiently. Specifically we propose to use a topological persistence-based feature vectorization framework. Existing methods to vectorize a neuron (i.e, convert a neuron to a feature vector so as to support efficient comparison and/or searching) typically rely on statistics or summaries of morphometric information, such as the average or maximum local torque angle or partition asymmetry. These simple summaries have limited power in encoding global tree structures. Based on the concept of topological persistence recently developed in the field of computational topology, we vectorize each neuron structure into a simple yet informative summary. In particular, each type of information of interest can be represented as a descriptor function defined on the neuron tree, which is then mapped to a simple persistence-signature. Our framework can encode both local and global tree structure, as well as other information of interest (electrophysiological or dynamical measures), by considering multiple descriptor functions on the neuron. The resulting persistence-based signature is potentially more informative than simple statistical summaries (such as average/mean/max) of morphometric quantities—Indeed, we show that using a certain descriptor function will give a persistence-based signature containing strictly more information than the classical Sholl analysis. At the same time, our framework retains the efficiency associated with treating neurons as points in a simple Euclidean feature space, which would be important for constructing efficient searching or indexing structures over them. We present preliminary experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our persistence-based neuronal feature vectorization framework.']",['https://github.com/Nevermore520/NeuronTools'],4.0,36.0

The importance of proper ChC function is further underscored by the association of ChC connectivity defects with various neurological conditions. Despite this, the cellular mechanisms governing ChC axo-axonic synapse formation remain poorly understood. Here, we identify microglia as key regulators of ChC axonal morphogenesis and AIS synaptogenesis, and show that disease-induced aberrant microglial activation perturbs proper ChC synaptic development/connectivity in the neocortex.

One often wishes to compute quantitative summaries of such structure—a basic example is the frequency spectrum—and compare with model-based predictions. The advent of large-scale population recordings affords the opportunity to do so in new ways, with the hope of distinguishing between potential explanations for why responses vary with time. We introduce a method that assesses a basic but previously unexplored form of population-level structure: when data contain responses across multiple neurons, conditions, and times, they are naturally expressed as a third-order tensor. We examined tensor structure for multiple datasets from primary visual cortex (V1) and primary motor cortex (M1). All V1 datasets were ‘simplest’ (there were relatively few degrees of freedom) along the neuron mode, while all M1 datasets were simplest along the condition mode. These differences could not be inferred from surface-level response features. Formal considerations suggest why tensor structure might differ across modes. For idealized linear models, structure is simplest across the neuron mode when responses reflect external variables, and simplest across the condition mode when responses reflect population dynamics. This same pattern was present for existing models that seek to explain motor cortex responses. Critically, only dynamical models displayed tensor structure that agreed with the empirical M1 data. These results illustrate that tensor structure is a basic feature of the data. For M1 the tensor structure was compatible with only a subset of existing models.', 'Neuroscientists commonly measure the time-varying activity of neurons in the brain. Early studies explored how such activity directly encodes sensory stimuli. Since then neural responses have also been found to encode abstract parameters such as expected reward. Yet not all aspects of neural activity directly encode identifiable parameters: patterns of activity sometimes reflect the evolution of underlying internal computations, and may be only obliquely related to specific parameters. For example, it remains debated whether cortical activity during movement relates to parameters such as reach velocity, to parameters such as muscle activity, or to underlying computations that culminate in the production of muscle activity. To address this question we exploited an unexpected fact. When activity directly encodes a parameter it tends to be mathematically simple in a very particular way. When activity reflects the evolution of a computation being performed by the network, it tends to be mathematically simple in a different way. We found that responses in a visual area were simple in the first way, consistent with encoding of parameters. We found that responses in a motor area were simple in the second way, consistent with participation in the underlying computations that culminate in movement.']","['http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.92h5d', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.92h5d']",3.0,29.0

The observed sections are modelled as Gaussian random fields conditioned on a sequence of unknown section by section rigid motions and unknown diffeomorphic transformation of a three-dimensional atlas. To regularize over the high-dimensionality of our parameter space (which is a product space of the rigid motion dimensions and the diffeomorphism dimensions), the histology stacks are modelled as arising from a first order Sobolev space smoothness prior. We show that the joint maximum a-posteriori, penalized-likelihood estimator of our high dimensional parameter space emerges as a joint optimization interleaving rigid motion estimation for histology restacking and large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping to atlas coordinates. We show that joint optimization in this parameter space solves the classical curvature non-identifiability of the histology stacking problem. The algorithms are demonstrated on a collection of whole-brain histological image stacks from the Mouse Brain Architecture Project.', 'New developments in neural tracing techniques have motivated the widespread use of histology as a modality for exploring the circuitry of the brain. Automated mapping of pre-labeled atlases onto modern large datasets of histological imagery is a critical step for elucidating the brain’s neural circuitry and shape. This task is challenging as histological sections are imaged independently and the reconstruction of the unsectioned volume is nontrivial. Typically, neuroanatomists use reference volumes of the same subject (e.g. MRI) to guide reconstruction. However, obtaining reference imagery is often non-standard, as in high-throughput animal models like mouse histology. Others have proposed using anatomical atlases as guides, but have not accounted for the intrinsic nonlinear shape difference from atlas to subject. Our method addresses these limitations by jointly optimizing reconstruction informed by an atlas simultaneously with the nonlinear change of coordinates that encapsulates anatomical variation.

Despite progress in understanding how different stimuli are represented by changes in neuronal activity, less is known about how they affect broader neural network properties. We developed a framework for using graph-theoretic features of neural network activity to predict ecologically relevant stimulus properties, in particular stimulus identity. We used the transparent nematode, ', ', with its small nervous system to define neural network features associated with various chemosensory stimuli. We first immobilized animals using a microfluidic device and exposed their noses to chemical stimuli while monitoring changes in neural activity of more than 50 neurons in the head region. We found that graph-theoretic features, which capture patterns of interactions between neurons, are modulated by stimulus identity. Further, we show that a simple machine learning classifier trained using graph-theoretic features alone, or in combination with neural activity features, can accurately predict salt stimulus. Moreover, by focusing on putative causal interactions between neurons, the graph-theoretic features were almost twice as predictive as the neural activity features. These results reveal that stimulus identity modulates the broad, network-level organization of the nervous system, and that graph theory can be used to characterize these changes.', 'Animals use their nervous systems to detect and respond to changes in their external environment. A central challenge in computational neuroscience is to determine how specific properties of these stimuli affect interactions between neurons.

We recorded activity of neurons within the ', '. ', ' head region while the animal was exposed to various chemosensory stimuli. We then used computational methods to identify various stimuli by analyzing neural activity. Specifically, we used a combination of population-level activity statistics (e.g., average, standard deviation, frequency-based measures) and graph-theoretic features of functional network structure (e.g., transitivity, which is the existence of strongly connected triplets of neurons) to accurately predict salt stimulus. Our method is general and can be used across species, particularly in instances where the identities of individual neurons are unknown.

Here we characterized IDRs using protein sequence annotations of functional sites and regions available in the UniProt knowledgebase (“UniProt features”: active site, ligand-binding pocket, regions mediating protein-protein interactions, etc.). By measuring the statistical enrichment of twenty-five UniProt features in 981 IDRs of 561 human proteins, we identified eight features that are commonly located in IDRs. We then collected the genetic variant data from the general population and patient-based databases and evaluated the prevalence of population and pathogenic variations in IDPs/IDRs.

Using genetic variant data from across the human genome, we find evidence that selection increases with the length of the unbroken hydrophobic sequence. These results could lead to improvements in a wide range of genomic tools as well as insights into protein-aggregation disease etiology and protein evolutionary history.', 'Hydrophobic interactions have long been established as essential for stabilizing structured proteins as well as drivers of aggregation, but the impact of hydrophobicity on the functional significance of sequence variants has rarely been considered in a genome-wide context.

We find that functional impact is uncorrelated with hydrophobicity of the SNP itself and only weakly correlated with the average local hydrophobicity, but is strongly correlated with both the size and minimum hydrophobicity of the contiguously hydrophobic sequence (or “blob”) that contains the SNP. Disease association is found to vary by more than sixfold as a function of contiguous hydrophobicity parameters, suggesting utility as a prior for identifying causal variation. We further find signatures of differential selective constraint on hydrophobic blobs and that SNPs splitting a long hydrophobic blob or joining two short hydrophobic blobs are particularly likely to be disease associated.

In this work we examine how DNA sequence determines one of the most important features of a promoter, the strength with which a transcription factor binds to its DNA binding site. We discuss an approach to modeling DNA sequence-specific transcription factor binding energies ', ' using a massively parellel reporter assay. We develop models that allow us to predict the binding energy between a transcription factor and a mutated version of its binding site. We then show that this modeling technique can be used to address a number of scientific and design questions, such as engineering the behavior of genetic circuit elements or examining how transcription factors and their binding sites co-evolve.']","['https://www.github.com/rpgroup-pboc/seq_mapping', 'https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1108']",3.0,21.0

To determine what fraction was active in promoting tumorigenicity, we chose five representative fibroblast-secreted factors for ', ' analysis. We found that the majority (three out of five) played equally major roles in promoting tumorigenicity, and intriguingly, each one had distinct effects on the tumor microenvironment.

Here, we show that for large distributed routing networks, network function is markedly enhanced by hyper-connectivity followed by aggressive pruning and that the global rate of pruning, a developmental parameter not previously studied by experimentalists, plays a critical role in optimizing network structure. We first used high-throughput image analysis techniques to quantify the rate of pruning in the mammalian neocortex across a broad developmental time window and found that the rate is decreasing over time. Based on these results, we analyzed a model of computational routing networks and show using both theoretical analysis and simulations that decreasing rates lead to more robust and efficient networks compared to other rates.

Thus, inspiration from neural network formation suggests effective ways to design distributed networks across several domains.', 'During development of neural circuits in the brain, synapses are massively over-produced and then pruned-back over time.

We performed large-scale brain imaging experiments to quantify synapse elimination rates in the developing mouse cortex and found that the rate is decreasing over time (i.e. aggressive elimination occurs early, followed by a longer phase of slow elimination).

BRD9 is a component of SS18-SSX containing BAF complexes in synovial sarcoma cells; and integration of BRD9 into these complexes is critical for cell growth. Moreover BRD9 and SS18-SSX co-localize extensively on the synovial sarcoma genome. Remarkably, synovial sarcoma cells are highly sensitive to a novel small molecule degrader of BRD9, while other sarcoma subtypes are unaffected. Degradation of BRD9 induces downregulation of oncogenic transcriptional programs and inhibits tumour progression in vivo. We demonstrate that BRD9 supports oncogenic mechanisms underlying the SS18-SSX fusion in synovial sarcoma and highlight targeted degradation of BRD9 as a potential therapeutic opportunity in this disease.']",['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE113229'],3.0,92.0

Agos bind small RNAs (sRNAs) including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) to form the functional core of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The sRNA is used as a guide to target mRNAs containing either partially or fully complementary sequences, ultimately leading to downregulation of the corresponding proteins. It was previously shown that the kinase CK1α phosphorylates a cluster of residues in the eukaryotic insertion (EI) of Ago, leading to the alleviation of miRNA-mediated repression through an undetermined mechanism. We show that binding of miRNA-loaded human Ago2 to target RNA with complementarity to the seed and 3’ supplementary regions of the miRNA primes the EI for hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1α. The added negative charges electrostatically promote target release, freeing Ago to seek out additional targets once it is dephosphorylated. The high conservation of potential phosphosites in the EI suggests that such a regulatory strategy may be a shared mechanism for regulating miRNA-mediated repression.', 'Proteins are the chemical ‘workhorses’ of the cell: some help maintain a cell’s shape or structure, while others carry out the chemical reactions necessary for life. Organisms therefore need to keep tight control over the production of proteins in their cells, so that the right amount of each protein is made at the right time, in the right place.', 'Instructions for making new proteins are encoded in a type of molecule called messenger RNA. Each messenger RNA contains the instructions for one protein, which are then ‘read’ and carried out by special cellular machinery called ribosomes. The cell can control how much protein it produces by regulating both the levels of different messenger RNA and the amount of protein ribosomes are allowed to make from those instructions.', 'The main way to regulate the levels of messenger RNA is through their transcription from the genome. However, this needs fine tuning. Cells can do this in a highly specific way using molecules called microRNAs. A microRNA works by directing a protein called Argonaute to the messenger RNA that it targets. Once Argonaute arrives, it can call in additional ‘helper proteins’ to shut down, or reduce, protein production from that messenger RNA, or alternatively to break down the messenger RNA altogether.', 'Cells can use an enzyme called CK1α to attach bulky chemical groups onto a specific part of the Argonaute protein, in a reaction termed phosphorylation. The ability to carry out this reaction (and to reverse it) also seems to be important for microRNAs to do their job properly, but why has remained unknown. Bibel et al. wanted to determine what triggers CK1α to phosphorylate Argonaute, and how this affects interactions between microRNAs, Argonaute and their target messenger RNAs.', 'A series of ‘test tube’ experiments looked at the interaction between purified CK1α and Argonaute under different conditions. These demonstrated that CK1α could only carry out its phosphorylation reaction when Argonaute was already interacting with a microRNA and its corresponding messenger RNA. Further measurements revealed that phosphorylation of Argonaute made it detach from the messenger RNA more quickly. This suggests that phosphorylation might be a way to let Argonaute seek out new messenger RNAs after blocking protein production at its first ‘target’.', 'These results shed new light on a fundamental mechanism that cells use to control protein production. Bibel et al. propose that this mechanism may be shared across many different species and could one day help guide the development of new medical therapies based on microRNAs.']","['https://massive.ucsd.edu/', 'https://github.com/komiveslab/DECA', 'https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:0b0e5b946973bd5ec839f4cbee951f32a1f0434b;origin=https://github.com/komiveslab/DECA;visit=swh:1:snp:ef2110304ae5882d9e9d99405f46f61a99c88b66;anchor=swh:1:rev:ec7a72e54aa1d025342fcdcb3f61840e08cd456f']",,2.0

Although principles governing small RNA sorting into RISC have been uncovered, the spectrum of RNA species that can be targeted by Dicer proteins, particularly the viral RNAs present during an infection, are poorly understood.

Hurst', 'Avazeh T. Ghanbarian', 'Alistair R. R. Forrest', 'Lukasz Huminiecki']",['PLoS Biology'],[],26685068,['4686125'],10.1371/journal.pbio.1002315,"['X chromosomes are unusual in many regards, not least of which is their nonrandom gene content. The causes of this bias are commonly discussed in the context of sexual antagonism and the avoidance of activity in the male germline. Here, we examine the notion that, at least in some taxa, functionally biased gene content may more profoundly be shaped by limits imposed on gene expression owing to haploid expression of the X chromosome. Notably, if the X, as in primates, is transcribed at rates comparable to the ancestral rate (per promoter) prior to the X chromosome formation, then the X is not a tolerable environment for genes with very high maximal net levels of expression, owing to transcriptional traffic jams. We test this hypothesis using The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and data from the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project. As predicted, the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is much lower than that of genes on autosomes: on average, maximal expression is three times lower on the X chromosome than on autosomes. Similarly, autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. Also as expected, X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression than autosomal ones (compared to the human/Chimpanzee common ancestor) if highly expressed, but not if lowly expressed. The traffic jam model also explains the known lower breadth of expression for genes on the X (and the Z of birds), as genes with broad expression are, on average, those with high maximal expression. As then further predicted, highly expressed tissue-specific genes are also rare on the X and broadly expressed genes on the X tend to be lowly expressed, both indicating that the trend is shaped by the maximal expression level not the breadth of expression per se. Importantly, a limit to the maximal expression level explains biased tissue of expression profiles of X-linked genes. Tissues whose tissue-specific genes are very highly expressed (e.g., secretory tissues, tissues abundant in structural proteins) are also tissues in which gene expression is relatively rare on the X chromosome. These trends cannot be fully accounted for in terms of alternative models of biased expression. In conclusion, the notion that it is hard for genes on the Therian X to be highly expressed, owing to transcriptional traffic jams, provides a simple yet robustly supported rationale of many peculiar features of X’s gene content, gene expression, and evolution.', 'Laurence Hurst, Lukasz Huminiecki, and the FANTOM5 consortium propose a new explanation for the peculiar expression properties of genes on the human X chromosome, based on the premise that very high expression levels cannot be achieved on a haploid-expressed chromosome.', 'Genes located on the human X chromosome are not a random mix of genes: they tend to be expressed in relatively few tissues or are specific for a particular set of tissues, e.g., brain regions. Prior attempts to explain this skewed gene content have hypothesized that the X chromosome might be peculiar because it has to balance mutations that are advantageous to one sex but deleterious to the other, or because it has to shut down during the process of sperm manufacture in males. Here we suggest and test a third possible explanation: that genes on the X chromosome are limited in their transcription levels and thus tend to be genes that are lowly or specifically expressed. We consider the suggestion that since these genes can only be expressed from one chromosome, as males only have one X, the ability to express a gene at very high rates is limited owing to potential transcriptional traffic jams. As predicted, we find that human X-located genes have maximal expression rates far below that of genes residing on autosomes. When we look at genes that have moved onto or off the X chromosome during recent evolution, we find the maximal expression is higher when not on the X chromosome. We also find that X-located genes that are relatively highly expressed are not able to increase their expression level further. Our model explains both the enrichment for tissue specificity and the paucity of certain tissues with X-located genes. Genes underrepresented on the X are either expressed in many tissues—such genes tend to have high maximal expression—or are from tissues that require a lot of transcription (e.g., fast secreting tissues like the liver). Just as many of the findings cannot be explained by the two earlier models, neither can the traffic jam model explain all the peculiar features of the genes found on the X chromosome. Indeed, we find evidence of a reproduction-related bias in X-located genes, even after allowing for the traffic jam problem.']","['http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/', 'http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeRegTfbsClustered/', 'http://www.treefam.org/', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.p4s57/']",3.0,18.0

Here we examined the neuronal correlates of an auditory-tactile stimulus sequence in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) using 2-photon calcium imaging in awake mice. We find that neuronal subpopulations in layer 2/3 of PPC reliably represent texture-touch events, in addition to auditory cues that presage the incoming tactile stimulus. Notably, altering the flow of sensory events through omission of the cued texture touch elicited large responses in a subset of neurons hardly responsive to or even inhibited by the tactile stimuli. Hence, PPC neurons were able to discriminate not only tactile stimulus features (i.e., texture graininess) but also between the presence and omission of the texture stimulus. Whereas some of the neurons responsive to texture omission were driven by looming-like auditory sounds others became recruited only with tactile sensory experience. These findings indicate that layer 2/3 neuronal populations in PPC potentially encode correlates of expectancy in addition to auditory and tactile stimuli.']",[],1.0,9.0

Links between branches, however, can be ephemeral, easily destroyed by wind, rain, or animal movements. Here we report a biologically feasible distributed algorithm, parameterized using field data, that can plausibly describe how turtle ants maintain the routing backbone and find alternative paths to circumvent broken links in the backbone. We validate the ability of this probabilistic algorithm to circumvent simulated breaks in synthetic and real-world networks, and we derive an analytic explanation for why certain features are crucial to improve the algorithm’s success.

Targeting oncogenic KRAS eliminates the negative feedback on WT RAS and highlights a role for WT RAS signaling in promoting adaptive resistance to mutant KRAS ablation.', 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy with limited treatment options. Although activating mutations of the KRAS GTPase are the predominant dependency present in >90% of PDAC patients, targeting KRAS mutants directly has been challenging in PDAC. Similarly, strategies targeting known KRAS downstream effectors have had limited clinical success due to feedback mechanisms, alternate pathways, and dose-limiting toxicities in normal tissues. Therefore, identifying additional functionally relevant KRAS interactions in PDAC may allow for a better understanding of feedback mechanisms and unveil potential therapeutic targets. Here, we used proximity labeling to identify protein interactors of active KRAS in PDAC cells.

Because HMGB1 is a well-characterized endogenous mediator, which stimulates inflammation and is expressed by neurons, we reasoned HMGB1 release may be an important component of neurogenic inflammation. Here, by combining optogenetics, neuronal-specific ablation, nerve-injury, and inflammatory disease models, with direct assessment of inflammation and neuropathic pain, we show that nociceptor HMGB1 is required for an inflammatory response. These results provide direct evidence that nociceptor-related pain and inflammation can be prevented by targeting HMGB1.', 'Inflammation, the body’s primary defensive response system to injury and infection, is triggered by molecular signatures of microbes and tissue injury.

Activation of nociceptors mediates inflammation through antidromic release of neuropeptides into infected or injured tissue, producing neurogenic inflammation. Because HMGB1 is an important inflammatory mediator that is synthesized by neurons, we reasoned nociceptor release of HMGB1 might be a component of the neuroinflammatory response. In support of this possibility, we show here that transgenic nociceptors expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) directly release HMGB1 in response to light stimulation.

A common assumption is that selection alone determines the course of adaptation from abundant preexisting variation. Yet, theoretical work shows broad conditions under which the mutation rate to a given type of variant strongly influences its probability of contributing to adaptation. Here we introduce a statistical approach to analyzing how mutation shapes protein sequence adaptation. Using large datasets from three different species, we show that the mutation spectrum has a proportional influence on the types of changes fixed in adaptation. We also show via computer simulations that a variety of factors can influence how closely the spectrum of adaptive substitutions reflects the spectrum of variants introduced by mutation.', 'Evolutionary adaptation often occurs by the fixation of beneficial mutations. This mode of adaptation can be characterized quantitatively by a spectrum of adaptive substitutions, i.e., a distribution for types of changes fixed in adaptation. Recent work establishes that the changes involved in adaptation reflect common types of mutations, raising the question of how strongly the mutation spectrum shapes the spectrum of adaptive substitutions. We address this question with a codon-based model for the spectrum of adaptive amino acid substitutions, applied to three large datasets covering thousands of amino acid changes identified in natural and experimental adaptation in ', ', ', ', and ', '. Using species-specific mutation spectra based on prior knowledge, we find that the mutation spectrum has a proportional influence on the spectrum of adaptive substitutions in all three species. Indeed, we find that by inferring the mutation rates that best explain the spectrum of adaptive substitutions, we can accurately recover the species-specific mutation spectra. However, we also find that the predictive power of the model differs substantially between the three species. To better understand these differences, we use population simulations to explore the factors that influence how closely the spectrum of adaptive substitutions mirrors the mutation spectrum.

Here we examined the feasibility and accuracy of computational inference of genetic ancestry relying exclusively on cancer-derived data. A data synthesis framework was developed to optimize and assess the performance of the ancestry inference for any given input cancer-derived molecular profile. In its core procedure, the ancestral background of the profiled patient is replaced with one of any number of individuals with known ancestry. The data synthesis framework is applicable to multiple profiling platforms, making it possible to assess the performance of inference specifically for a given molecular profile and separately for each continental-level ancestry; this ability extends to all ancestries, including those without statistically sufficient representation in the existing cancer data. The inference procedure was demonstrated to be accurate and robust in a wide range of sequencing depths. Testing of the approach in four representative cancer types and across three molecular profiling modalities showed that continental-level ancestry of patients can be inferred with high accuracy, as quantified by its agreement with the gold standard of deriving ancestry from matching cancer-free molecular data. This study demonstrates that vast amounts of existing cancer-derived molecular data are potentially amenable to ancestry-oriented studies of the disease without requiring matching cancer-free genomes or patient self-reported ancestry.']","['https://github.com/KrasnitzLab/RAIDS', 'https://krasnitzlab.github.io/RAIDS/']",3.0,3.0

This leaves us to ask, what is the most meaningful way to assess different alignment choices? And importantly, where is there room for progress? In this work, we explore the answers to these two questions by performing an exhaustive assessment of the STAR aligner. We assess STAR’s performance across a range of alignment parameters using common metrics, and then on biologically focused tasks. We find technical metrics such as fraction mapping or expression profile correlation to be uninformative, capturing properties unlikely to have any role in biological discovery. Surprisingly, we find that changes in alignment parameters within a wide range have little impact on both technical and biological performance. Yet, when performance finally does break, it happens in difficult regions, such as X-Y paralogs and MHC genes. We believe improved reporting by developers will help establish where results are likely to be robust or fragile, providing a better baseline to establish where methodological progress can still occur.']","['https://github.com/gillislab/aupairwise', 'https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/', 'http://metasra.biostat.wisc.edu/download.html']",,10.0

Zhang']",['PLoS Computational Biology'],[],22844240,['3406014'],10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002613,"[""Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have matured considerably since their introduction and a focus has been placed on developing sophisticated analytical tools to deal with the amassing volumes of data. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), a major application of NGS, is a widely adopted technique for examining protein-DNA interactions and is commonly used to investigate epigenetic signatures of diffuse histone marks. These datasets have notoriously high variance and subtle levels of enrichment across large expanses, making them exceedingly difficult to define. Windows-based, heuristic models and finite-state hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used with some success in analyzing ChIP-seq data but with lingering limitations. To improve the ability to detect broad regions of enrichment, we developed a stochastic Bayesian Change-Point (BCP) method, which addresses some of these unresolved issues. BCP makes use of recent advances in infinite-state HMMs by obtaining explicit formulas for posterior means of read densities. These posterior means can be used to categorize the genome into enriched and unenriched segments, as is customarily done, or examined for more detailed relationships since the underlying subpeaks are preserved rather than simplified into a binary classification. BCP performs a near exhaustive search of all possible change points between different posterior means at high-resolution to minimize the subjectivity of window sizes and is computationally efficient, due to a speed-up algorithm and the explicit formulas it employs. In the absence of a well-established “gold standard” for diffuse histone mark enrichment, we corroborated BCP's island detection accuracy and reproducibility using various forms of empirical evidence. We show that BCP is especially suited for analysis of diffuse histone ChIP-seq data but also effective in analyzing punctate transcription factor ChIP datasets, making it widely applicable for numerous experiment types."", 'To unravel the mechanisms of gene regulation, understanding the complex interplay of protein-DNA interactions is instrumental. Recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation, coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), has risen as the go-to technique for examining these interactions on a genome-wide scale. It has also given rise to new computational issues. One such difficulty is the large variation in read density profiles from different types of NGS data, including variable peak “shapes” ranging from punctate to diffuse enrichment segments. To address this issue, we developed an infinite-state hidden Markov model that resulted in explicit formulas for the estimation of read density enrichment and can be used to find both significant “peaks” and broad segments.

Here, we combined whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data with extensive gene expression and chromatin-state data to define functional classes of iHMRs, and to reconstruct the dynamics of their establishment in a developmental setting. Comparing HMR profiles in embryonic stem and primary blood cells, we show that iHMRs mark an exclusive subset of active DNase hypersensitive sites (DHS), and that both developmentally constitutive and cell-type-specific iHMRs display chromatin states typical of distinct regulatory elements. We also observe that iHMR changes are more predictive of nearby gene activity than the promoter HMR itself, and that expression of noncoding RNAs within the iHMR accompanies full activation and complete demethylation of mature B cell enhancers. Conserved sequence features corresponding to iHMR transcript start sites, including a discernible TATA motif, suggest a conserved, functional role for transcription in these regions. Similarly, we explored both primate-specific and human population variation at iHMRs, finding that while enhancer iHMRs are more variable in sequence and methylation status than any other functional class, conservation of the TATA box is highly predictive of iHMR maintenance, reflecting the impact of sequence plasticity and transcriptional signals on iHMR establishment. Overall, our analysis allowed us to construct a three-step timeline in which (1) intergenic DHS are pre-established in the stem cell, (2) partial demethylation of blood-specific intergenic DHSs occurs in blood progenitors, and (3) complete iHMR formation and transcription coincide with enhancer activation in lymphoid-specified cells.']","['http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/']",3.0,48.0

To understand the mechanisms and mediators regulating plasticity upon polarity loss, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of ', ' ovaries, where inducing polarity-gene ', '-knockdown (Lgl-KD) causes invasive multilayering of the follicular epithelia. Analyzing the integrated Lgl-KD and ', ' transcriptomes, we discovered the cells specific to the various discernible phenotypes and characterized the underlying gene expression. A genetic requirement of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in promoting multilayer formation of Lgl-KD cells was further identified. Ectopic expression of Keap1 increased the volume of delaminated follicle cells that showed enhanced invasive behavior with significant changes to the cytoskeleton. Overall, our findings describe the comprehensive transcriptome of cells within the follicle cell tumor model at the single-cell resolution and identify a previously unappreciated link between Keap1-Nrf2 signaling and cell plasticity at early tumorigenesis.', 'In the body, most cells exhibit some form of spatial asymmetry: the compartments within the cell are not evenly distributed, thereby allowing the cells to know whether a surface is on the ‘outside’ or the ‘inside’ of a tissue or organ. In the cells of epithelial tissues, which line most of the cavities and the organs in the body, this asymmetry is known as apical-basal polarity. Maintaining apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells is one of the main barriers that stops cancer cells from invading other tissues, which is the first step of metastasis, the process through which cancer cells leave their tissue of our origin and spread to distant locations in the body.', 'In the fruit fly ', ', scientists have engineered cells in several tissues to stop producing the proteins that help establish apical-basal polarity, in an effort to study the earliest steps of tumor formation. Unfortunately, these experiments frequently lead to rampant metastasis, making it difficult to identify the earliest changes that make the tumor cells more likely to become invasive. Therefore, finding a tissue in which loss of apical-basal polarity does not cause aggressive cancer progression is necessary to address this gap in knowledge.', 'The epithelial cell layer lining the ovaries of fruit flies may be such a tissue. When these cells lose their apical-basal polarity, rather than becoming metastatic and spreading to distant organs, they interleave with each other, forming a tumorous growth that only invades into the neighboring compartment. Chatterjee et al. used this system to study individual invasive cells. They wanted to know whether the genes that these cells switch on and off are known to be involved in human cancers, and if so, which of them control the invasive behavior of tumor cells.', 'Chatterjee et al. determined that when cells in the fruit-fly ovary lost their polarity, they turned genes on and off in a pattern similar to that seen both in mammalian cancers and in tumors from other fly tissues. One of the notable changes they observed in the ovarian cells that lost apical-basal polarity was the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 oxidative-stress signaling pathway, which normally protects cells from damage caused by excessive oxidation. In the ovarian cells, however, the activation of these genes also led to aggressive invasion of the collective tumor cells into the neighboring compartment.', 'Interestingly, this increase in invasiveness was characterized by polarized changes within the cells, specifically in the scaffolding that allows cells to keep their shape and move: the edge of the cells leading the invasion had greater levels of a protein called actin, which enables the cells to protrude into the neighboring compartments.', 'Chatterjee et al. have identified a new mechanism that impacts the migratory behavior of cells. Insights from their findings will pave the way for a better understanding of how and when this mechanism plays a role in metastasis.']","['https://github.com/chatterjee89/eLife2022-11-e80956', 'https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:544767c997b8595e2fa2dd39055a96c660f0d55f;origin=https://github.com/chatterjee89/eLife2022-11-e80956;visit=swh:1:snp:0573f54ea95af344893ae28ba50716c8a915b83f;anchor=swh:1:rev:b07579bd187bf32d99c5a2bf4836d0c2e9122e2d']",,1.0

Using an immune-competent liver cancer model in which senescence triggers CD8 T cell–mediated tumor rejection, we show that senescence also remodels the cell-surface proteome to alter how tumor cells sense environmental factors, as exemplified by type II interferon (IFNγ). Compared with proliferating cells, senescent cells upregulate the IFNγ receptor, become hypersensitized to microenvironmental IFNγ, and more robustly induce the antigen-presenting machinery—effects also recapitulated in human tumor cells undergoing therapy-induced senescence. Disruption of IFNγ sensing in senescent cells blunts their immune-mediated clearance without disabling the senescence state or its characteristic secretory program.

Here, we used a scalable pipeline', ' to map and characterize SV in 17,795 deeply sequenced human genomes. We publicly release site-frequency data to create the largest WGS-based SV resource to date. On average, individuals carry 2.9 rare SVs that alter coding regions, affecting the dosage or structure of 4.2 genes and accounting for 4.0-11.2% of rare high-impact coding alleles. Based on a computational model, we estimate that SVs account for 17.2% of rare alleles genome-wide with predicted deleterious effects equivalent to loss-of-function coding alleles; ~90% of such SVs are non-coding deletions (mean 19.1 per genome). We report 158,991 ultra-rare SVs and show that ~2% of individuals carry ultra-rare megabase-scale SVs, nearly half of which are balanced or complex rearrangements.

Viral supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hours post transfection and stored at −80°C.Drug treatmentsNutlin-3 (Selleck Chemicals S1061) was dissolved in DMSO at a stock concentration of 10 mM and used at a final concentration of 10 μM.Flow cytometric analysesGO validation experiments were measured in either a Thermo Fisher 2018 Attune NxT flow cytometer or a Guava Easycyte (Millipore). Fluorescence assisted cell sorting was performed in either BD FACS Aria II or Sony MA900 cell sorters.Protein analysis231’s PC9’s and 3T3s screen pellets were resuspended with 500ul RIPA buffer then centrifuged at 4°C at 13000rpm to collect protein lysates. Antibodies used for western blot analyses were: Cas9 (CellSignaling #19526S) and Actin (Abcam #ab49900).Animal workAnimalsAll mouse experiments were approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Internal Animal Care and Use Committee under MSKCC IACUC protocol 11–06-018. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and food and water were provided ad libitum. Foxn1nu (Swiss nude) mice were purchased from Envigo. All mice used were 6 to 8 week-old females.Pancreatic orthotopic transplantsFor transplantation of PDEC cells into the pancreas of adult mice animals were anesthetized and a survival surgery was performed to expose the pancreas. Independent of genotype a total of 1×105 PDEC cells resuspended in 25 μL of growth factor reduced Matrigel (354230; Corning) diluted 1:1 with cold OptiMEM (Gibco) were injected into the tail region of the pancreas of each mouse. Mice were monitored for tumor development over time by abdominal palpation and were euthanized upon developing overt disease and becoming moribund following disease monitoring guidelines of IACUC and the MSKCC Animal Facility.Genomic DNA isolationIsolation of gDNA from cellsGenomic DNA was extracted from cells using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Cell pellets were processed in parallel and resulting gDNA was resuspended in 100–200 μL of 10 mM Tris-Cl; 0.5 mM EDTA; pH 9.0. Samples from corresponding replicates from MBES and HBES screens were pooled at the gDNA level measured using a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher) and normalized before performing sequencing deconvolution.Isolation of gDNA from tumor tissuesGenomic DNA was extracted from tissues using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Multiple tumor fragments or nodules were microdissected and either processed immediately by finely mincing the tissue and incubating overnight in a lysis buffer containing proteinase K and following the manufacturer protocol or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until day of processing. Resulting gDNA was resuspended in 100–200 μL of 10 mM Tris-Cl; 0.5 mM EDTA; pH 9.0 measured using a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher) and normalized before assessing genome editing at the relevant locus of interest using deep sequencing.AMINEsearch bioinformatic pipelineWe developed a genome editing design tool AMINEsearch (Annotated Mutation-Informed Nucleotide Editing sgRNA search) implemented in R to comprehensively build libraries of annotated gene editing reagents to model a user-defined set of mutations. This algorithm can be applied to any sequencing dataset that uses standard maf format files. For further description of the algorithm and analysis including the process of library design Off-target analysis and conservation of variant protein sequence between human and mouse please see Supplementary Note 1.HBES and MBES library designMSK-IMPACT sequencing data (n=21694 tumors) was used to design sgRNAs and sensors compatible with commonly used BE configurations incorporating Cas variants (SpCas9 Cas9-NG xCas9 and ScCas9) combined within the FNLS or F2X (expanded window) BE vector variants (Supplementary Table 2a–b). IMPACT-derived outputs of AMINEsearch (Supplementary Table 2ce) were used to compile unique sensor constructs to construct HBES (Supplementary Table 2d) and MBES libraries (Supplementary Table 2f) that target the human and mouse genome respectively. These libraries served as the basis for experimental validation and screening of base editing sensors which are available under the “Sensor validated” tab of the BE-SCAN web portal (https://dowlab.shinyapps.io/BEscan/).AMINEsearch v2Modifications to the algorithm were made to increase functionality of the AMINEsearch algorithm. Specifically modifications were made to accommodate BE variants that edit outside the region complementary to the sgRNA (CDA-BE4). As the demands of running larger dataset grew we incorporated the capacity to run parallel execution on multiple cores or processors. The option to reverse the effects of mutations rather than model them given a list of pathogenic mutations as input was added. A known issue was addressed to handle multiple genotypes that converge on the same protein sequence substitution as independent mutations. Version 2 includes the ability to track expected variant protein sequence when modeling human mutations in the mouse genome (See Supplementary Note 1). Versions 1 and 2 of the algorithm can be accessed at https://github.com/Kastenhuber/AMINEsearch/tree/AMINEsearch_v1.0 and https://github.com/Kastenhuber/AMINEsearch/tree/AMINEsearch_v2.0 respectively and are generalizable to analyze new mutation datasets and/or new base editor configurations.Exploratory set of BE sensor predictionsWe applied the algorithm to the recently updated mutation dataset from the MSK-IMPACT platform6 containing 341736 total somatic cancer SNVs derived from targeted sequencing of 47550 tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. 17). This targeted sequencing panel captures the coding region of up to 580 genes. Candidates for base editing included 5542 unique SNVs classified as missense nonsense splice site or nonstop mutations which were observed greater than six or more times (&gt;0.01% frequency). We considered all combinations of 13 Cas9 orthologs and 11 deaminases yielding 143 possible base editor configurations (Supplementary Table 8). This includes configurations that have been extensively characterized as well as combinations of Cas9 orthologs and deaminases that have not yet been assembled and used experimentally. Collectively this exploratory set of sgRNA predictions provides a broad set of options to generate mutations in human and mouse (Supplementary Table 8). A searchable filterable interface for the exploratory predicted set of sgRNAs are available under the “Sensor Design - Human” and “Sensor Design - Mouse” tabs in the shiny app web portal alongside sensor validated sgRNAs in BE-SCAN (https://dowlab.shinyapps.io/BEscan/).Design and construction of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesBase editing sensor module designEach sensor module is composed of the following parts: 1) a 22nt long 5’ adapter/priming site with a Esp3I restriction site; 2) a 20nt long 5’ G-containing sgRNA; 3) a 93nt long improved SpCas9 sgRNA scaffold partially based on7; 4) an 11nt long sequence corresponding to the 5’ flanking sequence of the endogenous target site; 5) the 23nt cognate target site; 6) a 7nt long sequence corresponding to the 3’ flanking sequence of the endogenous target site; 7) and a 28nt long 3’ adapter/priming site with a EcoRI restriction site. Thus oligos encoding individual sensor modules are 204nt long.Cloning of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesDue to longer-than-average oligo length early attempts at design and construction of sensor libraries showed unacceptable synthesis and assembly error rates where in some instances over half of the sensors before or after assembly into the backbone were found to harbor insertions deletions single nucleotide mutations and incorrect chimeric sgRNA-target site molecules (data not shown). Through extensive trial and error we found that assembling sensor libraries using Agilent’s High Fidelity oligo synthesis platform significantly mitigated these issues.All PAM sensor (APS) (1152 oligos white-listed) MBES (4686 oligos) and HBES (5855 oligos) libraries were cloned into the pLRT2B backbone1 as follows (all library oligos are in Supplementary Table 2). Briefly each oligo pool was amplified using forward and reverse primers that append Esp3I and EcoRI sites to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the sensor insert purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and ligated into Esp3I-digested and dephosphorylated pLRT2B vector using high-concentration T4 DNA ligase (NEB) (all cloning and sequencing oligos are in Supplementary Table 9). To ensure maximum library recovery we set up n=24 parallel PCR reactions per pool. A minimum of 2.4 ug of ligated pLRT2B plasmid DNA per pool (corresponding to n=8 ligations) was electroporated into Endura electrocompetent cells (Lucigen) recovered for one hour at 37C plated across four 15cm LB-Carbenicillin plates (Teknova) and incubated at 37°C for 16 hours. The total number of bacterial colonies per pool was quantified using serial dilution plates to ensure a library representation of &gt;10000X. The next morning bacterial colonies were scraped and briefly expanded for 4 hours at 37°C in 500mL of LB-Carbenicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Plasmid Plus Maxi Kit (Qiagen). To assess sensor distribution and fidelity of assembly per pool we amplified the sensor region using primers that append Illumina sequencing adapters on the 5’ and 3’ ends of the amplicon as well as a random nucleotide stagger and unique demultiplexing barcode on the 5’ end (Supplementary Table 9). Library amplicons were size-selected on a 2.5% agarose gel purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument.Analysis of base editing activity using GO reporter systemBase editor expressing cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells/well in 12 well plates and transduced 24 hours later with a defined amount of GO reporter to achieve 20–50% transduction efficiency. Virus-containing media was replaced with complete media 24 hours post-transduction and cells were harvested for flow cytometry at 96 hours post-transduction. We used an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher). Cells were trypsinized with a 100 μl of 0.25% Trypsin+EDTA and resuspended in 300 μl of complete medium in a 96 well U bottom plate. Data was acquired at a flow rate of 500 μl/min and at least 10000 events from the single cell population gating were recorded.Screening and deconvolution of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesScreening of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesWe first screened the APS library in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing one of nine different base editors as well as either the Cas9 or Cas9-NG nucleases as cutting controls. APS screens were performed essentially as described below in detail. We then screened a total of five mouse and human base editor-expressing cell lines with either MBES or HBES libraries using the following approach. Human cell lines (MDA-MD-231 and PC9) were screened with MBES to minimize fitness differences between sensor modules due to endogenous targeting of genes that suppress cellular proliferation. Following the same rationale mouse cell lines (KPT1 NIH3T3 and PDECs) were screened with HBES. Each screen (including the APS set) was performed as follows. To ensure that most cells harbor a single sgRNA integration event we determined the volume of viral supernatant that would achieve an MOI between ~0.3–0.5 upon standard transduction of a population of base editor-expressing cells. All screens were performed in technical duplicate and each step of the screen – from infection to sequencing – was optimized to achieve a minimum representation of 1000X. For instance to ensure a representation of &gt;1000X for HBES libraries at the transduction step we spinfected a total of 24 million cells across two 12-well plates per technical replicate using the volume of viral supernatant that would achieve a 30% infection rate (~7.2 million transduced cells per technical replicate). 24 hours after infection cells from each corresponding replicate were pooled into a minimum of 2 × 150mm tissue culture dishes (Corning) and selected with Blasticidin S (Gibco) at an empirically-determined final concentration ranging from 5 μg/mL to 30 μg/mL depending on the cell line. Cells were cultured and kept under Blasticidin selection for seven days post-transduction. When needed cells were trypsinized and re-plated at a minimum of 6 million cells per replicate to ensure a minimum representation of 1000X. For PDEC screens cell representation per replicate was maintained at &gt;600X at all points. Subsequently at least 6 million cells were pelleted and stored at −20°C. Genomic DNA (gDNA) from cells was isolated using the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Genomic DNA was harvested from all timepoints and both sensor BE activity and sgRNA abundance were assessed via NGS.Deconvolution of mouse and human base editing sensor screensWe assumed that each cell contains approximately 6.6 pg of gDNA. Therefore screen deconvolution at 1000X required sampling ~6 million × 6.6 pg of gDNA or ~39.6 ug. We employed a modified 2-step PCR version of the protocol published by Doench et al8 adapted to our unique library design. Briefly we performed an initial PCR whereby the integrated sensor cassettes were amplified from gDNA followed by a second PCR to append Illumina sequencing adapters on the 5’ and 3’ ends of the amplicon as well as a random hexamer and unique demultiplexing barcode on the 5’ end. Each “PCR1” reaction contained either 25 μL of Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB) 2.5 μL of Sensor_v6_Fwd Primer (10 μM) 2.5 μL of Sensor_v6_Rev Primer (10 μM) and 5 μg of gDNA in 20 μL of water (for a total volume of 50 μL per reaction) or 10μL of Herculase II 5X Master Mix (Agilent) 0.5 uL dNTPs 2.5 μL of Sensor_v6_Fwd Primer (10 μM) 2.5 μL of Sensor_v6_Rev Primer (10 μM) 1 uL of Herculase II polymerase and 5 μg of gDNA in 33.5 μL of water (for a total volume of 50 μL per reaction). The number of PCR1 reactions was scaled accordingly; therefore we performed eight PCR1 reactions per technical replicate and time point for all screens. PCR1 amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and used as template for “PCR2” reactions. Each PCR2 reaction contained either 25 μL of NEBNext 2X Master Mix (NEB) 2.5 μL of a uniquely barcoded PCR2_Fwd Primer (10 μM) 2.5 μL of a common PCR2_Rev Primer (10 μM) and 300 ng of PCR1 product in 20 μL of water (for a total volume of 50 μL per reaction). We performed two PCR2 reactions per PCR1 product. Library amplicons were size-selected either on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) or using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) followed by normalization pooling and sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (150 nt paired-end reads). All primer sequences are available in Supplementary Table 6. PCR program for PCR1 using Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB) was: 1) 98°C × 30s; 2) 98°C × 10s; 3) 55°C × 30s; 4) 72°C × 30s; 5) Go to step 2 × 24 cycles; 6) 72°C × 2 min; 7) 4°C forever. When using Herculase II denaturation steps were done at 95°C and the initial denaturation lasted for 2 minutes. PCR program for PCR2 using NEBNext 2X Master Mix (NEB) was: 1) 98°C × 30s; 2) 98°C × 10s; 3) 65°C × 30s; 4) 72°C × 30s; 5) Go to step 2 × 17 cycles; 6) 72°C × 2 min; 7) 4°C forever.Analysis of mouse and human base editing sensor screening dataTo quantify base editing outcomes raw paired-end FASTQ reads were paired using Pandaseq and merged FASTQ files were used as input for downstream analysis. We first removed reads with mutated sgRNAs or scaffolds or reads with non-matching sgRNA and target sequences (due to templates switching during PCR amplification). Next the 5’ scaffold and linker were used to associate each sgRNA with the read; sgRNAs that did not match the whitelist were also discarded. All remaining reads were aligned to their cognate target found in the whitelist and aligned reads with no indels were considered for base editing analysis. Sensors that deviated from the expected length were flagged as indels and their actual frequency calculated as a specific insertion or deletion. Editing events were classified over all cytosines within a −5 to 20 position window of the target where 1 is defined as the first position of the protospacer. Target cytosine editing (tCTN tCGN tCAN) quantified the frequency of editing at the target cytosine regardless of editing at other adjacent cytosines. Target cytosine editing without collateral editing (tCT) was measured as specific C&gt;T editing without associated mutations at adjacent sites. Purity values were calculated as the ratio of tCT/tCTN. Custom code to perform the BE analysis is available at: https://github.com/schmidt73/base-editing-analysis. All data for APS HBES and MBES screens can be found in Supplementary Tables 1 4 and 5 respectively.Comparison of base editing sensor screening outcomes with BE-HiveTo consider the performance of the BE-Hive base-editing outcome prediction model in relation to our data we pulled the fully trained network from the Github repository linked by Arbab et. al9. This model is split into two parts: a component that predicts the probability of any edit occurring and another that predicts the probability of a specific base editing outcome conditioned on any editing occurring. These are referred to as the editing efficiency and bystander model respectively. Per instructions we fed in our input spacer and its 50-mer context to both models and computed the posterior probability of each observed outcome using the chain rule. One caveat is that the editing efficiency model directly predicts an un-transformed score not a probability. To convert this to a probability we sigmoid transformed it into the unit interval [0 1]. Following the recommendations provided in their README file we first linearly re-scaled the score using the mean and standard deviation of reads prior to sigmoid transforming it into a probability to account for variance in base editor expression by experimental condition and cell-type. We note that this is a monotonic operation; therefore it should not affect any SpearmanR correlations used to analyze performance.BE-Hive does not consider PAM sequence as a feature in their prediction mode. Given that the PAM is an important determinant of the activity of standard base editors we considered two different sets of sgRNAs in our comparisons. First we considered all sgRNAs used in our screen. Second we considered only the sgRNAs with canonical NGG PAMs.Phenotypic screens using base editing sensor librariesStable base editor-expressing KrasG12D/+; Trp53WT/WT pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs)5 were generated by lentiviral transduction with FNLS (Addgene #110841) and validated using GO3 (Addgene #136896). Phenotypic MBES screens in FNLS-PDECs were set up essentially as described above for HBES/MBES sensor screens with a few modifications. MBES FNLS-PDEC screens were performed across six independent transduction replicates in parallel. Each replicate was maintained at a minimum 500X representation at every step of the screen by replating 3 million cells per time point and pelleting the rest of the cells for gDNA isolation and screen deconvolution. Screens ran for approximately 36 cumulative population doublings across 34 days after which we isolated gDNA and proceeded to perform screen deconvolution essentially as described above for MBES/HBES screens.Proliferation screen analysisPaired-end reads were joined using Pandaseq. Merged reads were processed as described for BE analysis above. Total read counts for each replicate were used as input for MAGeCK10 11 analysis. Any sgRNA with read counts &lt; 100 were removed from analysis. Comparisons of T0 (day 5 post-transduction) versus T1 (day 14) and T2 (day 30 post-transduction) for each replicate were performed using MAGeCK to determine log fold changes. Base editing outcomes at the sensor target site were concurrently measured using the sensor screen pipeline described above.Validation experimentsFor validation of individual targets sgRNAs were cloned into the lentiviral guide expression vector LRT2B (Addgene #110854) and lentiviral particles were produced as described above. Base editor expressing cells were plated at a density of 25000 cells/well in 12 well plates and were infected 24-hours later with enough virus to achieve 50% transduction efficiency. Virus-containing media was replaced with complete media 24 hours post-transduction and cells were plated into selection media containing 3 μg/mL Blasticidin S (Gibco). Experimental cells remained in selection media until the final collection time point at 7 days post-transduction. Final LRT2B infection efficiency was determined by measuring the levels of tdTomato in 10% of the cells remaining at day 7 using flow cytometry. Genomic DNA was isolated using the protocol found on dowlab.org/protocols and targets were amplified using a 100 μl reaction following the standard NEB Taq 2x MM protocol with primers found in Supplementary Table 9. Each PCR was performed 3X/target and pooled. Amplicons were confirmed on a 2% agarose gel and PCR purified using QIAGEN QIAquick PCR purification kit. DNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop and samples were normalized to 20 ng/μl and sequenced using EZ-amplicon sequencing (MiSeq; 2 × 250bp) by GENEWIZ Inc (South Plainfield NJ USA).Analysis of deep sequencing data from validation experimentsCRISPResso212 was used to process sequencing reads from the validation experiments and the corresponding sensor sequencing results for each individual target. The data was analyzed on default CRISPResso2 base editor mode with the exception to the following parameters for endogenous locus results: -quantification_window_center −15 and sensor results: --quantification_window_size 10 --quantification_window_size 10 --base_editor_output --quantification_window_center −15 --exclude_bp_from_right 1 --plot_window_size 18. To calculate target C&gt;T editing and non-canonical editing we used the “Alleles_frequency_table_around_sgRNA.txt” file to get the read counts for a specific allele.Statistical analyses and Data VisualizationAnalysis and data visualization in RHeatmaps dotplots and correlation analyses (including correlation graphs) were performed in R version 3.6.3 and plots were produced using the ggplot2 and ggpubr package. Statistical considerations are reported in each figure legend.Analysis and data visualization in GraphPad PRISMAdditional bar plots survival curves and associated statistical analyses were generated using Prism 8 (GraphPad) and are indicated in figure legends. Error bars represent standard deviation unless otherwise noted. We used Student’s t-test (unpaired two-tailed) to assess significance between experimental and control groups and to calculate P values. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

To address this gap, we examined population responses in motor cortex during reach preparation and movement. We found that there exist exclusive and orthogonal population-level subspaces dedicated to preparatory and movement computations. This orthogonality yielded a reorganization in response correlations: the set of neurons with shared response properties changed completely between preparation and movement. Thus, the same neural population acts, at different times, as two separate circuits with very different properties. This finding is not predicted by existing motor cortical models, which predict overlapping preparation-related and movement-related subspaces. Despite orthogonality, responses in the preparatory subspace were lawfully related to subsequent responses in the movement subspace.

Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658\xa0whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4–5\xa0driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition.

Lin28 modulates the switch via recruitment of TUT4(7) to pre-let-7 in stem cells and human cancers. We found TUT4(7) utilize two multi-domain functional modules during the switch from mono- to oligoU. The catalytic module (CM) is essential for both activities, while the Lin28-interacting module (LIM) is indispensible for oligoU. The TUT7 CM structure trapped in the monoU state, revealed a duplex RNA binding pocket that orients group II pre-let-7 hairpins to position the 1-nt overhang favor monoU addition. Conversely, the switch to oligoU requires the ZK domain of Lin28 to drive the formation of a stable ternary complex between pre-let-7 and the inactive LIM. Finally, ZK2 of TUT4(7) aids oligoU addition by engaging the growing oligoU tail through uracil-specific interactions.']",[],3.0,34.0

Previously, we identified a cortical neuron type, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, in auditory cortex that is recruited by behavioral reinforcers and mediates disinhibitory control by inhibiting other inhibitory neurons. As the same disinhibitory cortical circuit is present virtually throughout cortex, we wondered whether VIP neurons are likewise recruited by reinforcers throughout cortex. We monitored VIP neural activity in dozens of cortical regions using three-dimensional random access two-photon microscopy and fiber photometry while mice learned an auditory discrimination task. We found that reward and punishment during initial learning produce rapid, cortex-wide activation of most VIP interneurons. This global recruitment mode showed variations in temporal dynamics in individual neurons and across areas. Neither the weak sensory tuning of VIP interneurons in visual cortex nor their arousal state modulation was fully predictive of reinforcer responses.

We find that ancient genes are expressed in multiple cell types and have well conserved coexpression patterns, however they are expressed at different levels across cell types.

The routing backbone of the trail networks of arboreal turtle ants (', ') connects many nests and food sources using trail pheromone deposited by ants as they walk. Unlike species that forage on the ground, the trail networks of arboreal ants are constrained by the vegetation. We examined what objectives the trail networks meet by comparing the observed ant trail networks with networks of random, hypothetical trail networks in the same surrounding vegetation and with trails optimized for four objectives: minimizing path length, minimizing average edge length, minimizing number of nodes, and minimizing opportunities to get lost. The ants’ trails minimized path length by minimizing the number of nodes traversed rather than choosing short edges. In addition, the ants’ trails reduced the opportunity for ants to get lost at each node, favoring nodes with 3D configurations most likely to be reinforced by pheromone. Thus, rather than finding the shortest edges, turtle ant trail networks take advantage of natural variation in the environment to favor coherence, keeping the ants together on the trails.', 'We investigated the trail networks of arboreal turtle ants in the canopy of the tropical forest, to ask what characterizes the colony’s choice of foraging paths within the vegetation. We monitored day to day changes in the junctions and edges of trail networks of colonies in the dry forest of western Mexico. We compared the paths used by the ants to simulated random paths in the surrounding vegetation. We found that the paths of turtle ants prioritize coherence, keeping ants together on the trail, over minimizing the average edge length. The choice of paths reduces the number of junctions in the trail where ants could get lost, and favors junctions with a physical configuration that makes it likely that successive ants will reinforce the same path. Our work suggests that design principles that emphasize keeping information flow constrained to streamlined, coherent trails may be useful in human-designed distributed routing and transport networks or robot swarms.']","['https://purl.stanford.edu/qy007jv4648', 'https://github.com/arjunc12/TurtleAntObjectivesPCB2021']",3.0,3.0

We propose a novel explanation: lapses reflect a strategic trade-off between exploiting known rewarding actions and exploring uncertain ones. We tested this model’s predictions by selectively manipulating one action’s reward magnitude or probability. As uniquely predicted by this model, changes were restricted to lapses associated with that action. Finally, we show that lapses are a powerful tool for assigning decision-related computations to neural structures based on disruption experiments (here, posterior striatum and secondary motor cortex).

Reproducibility, however, has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. Here, we show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. We adopted a task for head-fixed mice that assays perceptual and value-based decision making, and we standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and we collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories. They establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.', 'In science, it is of vital importance that multiple studies corroborate the same result. Researchers therefore need to know all the details of previous experiments in order to implement the procedures as exactly as possible. However, this is becoming a major problem in neuroscience, as animal studies of behavior have proven to be hard to reproduce, and most experiments are never replicated by other laboratories.', 'Mice are increasingly being used to study the neural mechanisms of decision making, taking advantage of the genetic, imaging and physiological tools that are available for mouse brains. Yet, the lack of standardized behavioral assays is leading to inconsistent results between laboratories. This makes it challenging to carry out large-scale collaborations which have led to massive breakthroughs in other fields such as physics and genetics.', 'To help make these studies more reproducible, the International Brain Laboratory (a collaborative research group) et al. developed a standardized approach for investigating decision making in mice that incorporates every step of the process; from the training protocol to the software used to analyze the data. In the experiment, mice were shown images with different contrast and had to indicate, using a steering wheel, whether it appeared on their right or left. The mice then received a drop of sugar water for every correction decision. When the image contrast was high, mice could rely on their vision. However, when the image contrast was very low or zero, they needed to consider the information of previous trials and choose the side that had recently appeared more frequently.', 'This method was used to train 140 mice in seven laboratories from three different countries. The results showed that learning speed was different across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete the mice behaved consistently, relying on visual stimuli or experiences to guide their choices in a similar way.', 'These results show that complex behaviors in mice can be reproduced across multiple laboratories, providing an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools for studying decision making.

To improve our understanding of the molecular alterations that underlie deadly malignancies, we analyzed the genomic profiles of 17,879 tumors from patients with known outcomes. We find that mutations in almost all cancer driver genes contain remarkably little information on patient prognosis. However, CNAs in these same driver genes harbor significant prognostic power. Focal CNAs are associated with worse outcomes than broad alterations, and CNAs in many driver genes remain prognostic when controlling for stage, grade, ', ' status, and total aneuploidy. By performing a meta-analysis across independent patient cohorts, we identify robust prognostic biomarkers in specific cancer types, and we demonstrate that a subset of these alterations also confer specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. In total, our analysis establishes a comprehensive resource for cancer biomarker identification and underscores the importance of gene copy number profiling in assessing clinical risk.', 'Cancers are not created equal: even when the disease affects the same organ, it can run different courses between individuals. For example, amongst people with early-stage bowel cancer who undergo surgery, 60% will go on to live cancer-free but the remaining patients will see the illness come back within a few years. These differences in outcome are still poorly understood, but they may find their roots in the genetic changes present in tumor cells.', 'Comparing the genomes of healthy and cancerous cells can help to understand which genetic modifications makes a cell go ‘rogue’ and start to multiply uncontrollably. Often, this happens because of a mutation, a change in the letters that compose our genetic code. However, looking at genetic differences between cancerous cells from different patients, or different tumors, can shed light on how certain genetic changes make the disease deadlier or more likely to reoccur.', 'Smith and Sheltzer looked into the genomes of 17,879 tumors from patients whose clinical information was also available. The analysis revealed that specific genetic alterations were more common in either deadly or treatable cancers. Most of these changes were not mutations that affected a few DNA letters; instead, they were copy number alterations, whereby large portions of the genetic code are being repeated or deleted. These results suggest that while mutations certainly drive the development of the disease, other changes such as copy number alterations can tell us which cancers will be deadlier. Through this approach, Smith and Sheltzer were also able to identify copy number alterations that were associated with patients responding well to certain drugs.', 'These findings now need to be confirmed on a different set of data. If they hold, new technologies may be developed so that the approach can be used cheaply and easily in the clinic.

To gain insights into why a DNN makes a given prediction, model interpretability methods, such as attribution methods, can be employed to identify motif-like representations along a given sequence. Because explanations are given on an individual sequence basis and can vary substantially across sequences, deducing generalizable trends across the dataset and quantifying their effect size remains a challenge. Here we introduce global importance analysis (GIA), a model interpretability method that quantifies the population-level effect size that putative patterns have on model predictions. GIA provides an avenue to quantitatively test hypotheses of putative patterns and their interactions with other patterns, as well as map out specific functions the network has learned. As a case study, we demonstrate the utility of GIA on the computational task of predicting RNA-protein interactions from sequence. We first introduce a convolutional network, we call ResidualBind, and benchmark its performance against previous methods on RNAcompete data. Using GIA, we then demonstrate that in addition to sequence motifs, ResidualBind learns a model that considers the number of motifs, their spacing, and sequence context, such as RNA secondary structure and GC-bias.', 'Although deep neural networks are becoming widely applied in genomics, it remains unclear why they make a given prediction.

However, genome-wide information about p53-target gene regulation has been derived mostly from acute genotoxic conditions. Using ChIP-seq and expression data, we have found distinct p53 binding profiles between acutely activated (through DNA damage) and chronically activated (in senescent or pro-apoptotic conditions) p53. Compared to the classical ‘acute’ p53 binding profile, ‘chronic’ p53 peaks were closely associated with CpG-islands. Furthermore, the chronic CpG-island binding of p53 conferred distinct expression patterns between senescent and pro-apoptotic conditions. Using the p53 targets seen in the chronic conditions together with external high-throughput datasets, we have built p53 networks that revealed extensive self-regulatory ‘p53 hubs’ where p53 and many p53 targets can physically interact with each other. Integrating these results with public clinical datasets identified the cancer-associated lipogenic enzyme, ', ', which we found to be directly repressed by p53 through the CpG-island promoter, providing a mechanistic link between p53 and the ‘lipogenic phenotype’, a hallmark of cancer. Our data reveal distinct phenotype associations of chronic p53 targets that underlie specific gene regulatory mechanisms.', 'The p53 transcription factor is a frequently mutated tumour suppressor that contributes to repairing or eliminating damaged cells. Levels of p53 are typically regulated through its stability; it is constantly produced and degraded, so that upon stress, p53 is up-regulated quickly. This acutely induced p53 has been used as a major model system for studying genome-wide p53 targets. However, emerging evidence suggests that persistently activated p53 is involved in cancer-associated phenotypes, such as cellular senescence. We investigate genome-wide gene regulation by acutely induced p53 through DNA damage as well as chronically activated p53 in oncogene-induced senescence and pro-apoptotic states. Interestingly, acute and chronic p53 DNA binding profiles are highly distinctive, the latter being preferentially associated with larger and relatively open promoters called CpG islands. Furthermore, our integrative analyses of both p53-dependent gene expression and p53-binding genomic DNA profiles reveal that p53 and many of its targets in chronic conditions form extensive self-regulatory hubs, where they can physically interact. The data not only substantially extend the list of direct p53 targets but highlight unique gene regulation by chronic p53.

However, pancreatic cancers are often poorly vascularized and limited in glutamine supply, in alignment with recent concerns on the significance of glutaminolysis in pancreatic cancer.

Le Thomas et al. show that piRNA biogenesis in ', ' germ cells depends on the inheritance of homologous piRNAs from the previous generation. Transgenerationally inherited piRNAs trigger piRNA biogenesis in the progeny by two different mechanisms. First, inherited piRNAs guide post-transcriptional processing of precursors into mature piRNAs. Second, inherited piRNAs direct the modification of the chromatin state of cluster sequences. This study provides key insights into the transgenerational mechanism that specifies piRNA biogenesis in the germline.', 'Small noncoding RNAs that associate with Piwi proteins, called piRNAs, serve as guides for repression of diverse transposable elements in germ cells of metazoa. In ', ', the genomic regions that give rise to piRNAs, the so-called piRNA clusters, are transcribed to generate long precursor molecules that are processed into mature piRNAs. How genomic regions that give rise to piRNA precursor transcripts are differentiated from the rest of the genome and how these transcripts are specifically channeled into the piRNA biogenesis pathway are not known. We found that transgenerationally inherited piRNAs provide the critical trigger for piRNA production from homologous genomic regions in the next generation by two different mechanisms. First, inherited piRNAs enhance processing of homologous transcripts into mature piRNAs by initiating the ping-pong cycle in the cytoplasm. Second, inherited piRNAs induce installment of the histone 3 Lys9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) mark on genomic piRNA cluster sequences. The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) homolog Rhino binds to the H3K9me3 mark through its chromodomain and is enriched over piRNA clusters. Rhino recruits the piRNA biogenesis factor Cutoff to piRNA clusters and is required for efficient transcription of piRNA precursors. We propose that transgenerationally inherited piRNAs act as an epigenetic memory for identification of substrates for piRNA biogenesis on two levels: by inducing a permissive chromatin environment for piRNA precursor synthesis and by enhancing processing of these precursors.']",[],,142.0

Innovative computational methods are needed to analyze these neuronal traces. In particular, means to characterize the geometric properties of traced neurites along their trajectory have been lacking. Here, we propose a local tridimensional (3D) scale metric derived from differential geometry, measuring for each point of a curve the characteristic length where it is fully 3D as opposed to being embedded in a 2D plane or 1D line. The larger this metric is and the more complex the local 3D loops and turns of the curve are. Available through the GeNePy3D open-source Python quantitative geometry library (', '), this approach termed nAdder offers new means of describing and comparing axonal and dendritic arbors. We validate this metric on simulated and real traces.

New techniques enable to do so with increasingly higher throughput, up to every single neuron with so called ‘connectomic’ approaches. Up to now, the geometry of those traces has not been a focus of study and has mainly been analysed in bulk/on average. Here, we propose to quantitatively analyse the local 3D geometry of the curves that comprise neuron arbors. We introduce an algorithm that determines whether a locally-defined curve is best fit to a line, a plane or a 3D structure. We use it to compute a single number at each point of the trace, termed local 3D scale, that measures the characteristic size of the local 3D structure: the larger this local 3D scale metric, the more the neuron’s curve meanders in 3D locally. We reanalyse published neuronal traces to demonstrate that our local geometry approach enables to better characterize a neuron’s morphology, with direct relevance to understanding its development and function. The local 3D scale metric will be useful in all neuroscience research that works with neuronal traces, bringing a new, geometric layer of information.']",['https://genepy3d.gitlab.io/'],5.0,0.0

Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that cell death was associated with robust reactive oxygen species production and could be efficiently antagonized with antioxidants. Mass spectrometry was employed to demonstrate selective uptake into pancreatic cancer cells. Thus, targeted delivery of dm-Erastin via conjugation to the sigma-2 ligand SV119 produced efficient tumor control and prolonged animal survival with minimal off-target toxicities, and SW V-49 represents a promising new therapeutic with the potential to advance the fight against pancreatic cancer.']",[],0.0,17.0

Given recent advances in genomics and genetic screens, however, as well as an increasing urgency for the translation of effective preclinical treatments into the clinic, there is a pressing need to make these models easier and more efficient to work with. Accordingly, we have developed a versatile lentivirus-based approach to induce tumours from somatic cells of GEMs, add or subtract gene expression and render the tumours imageable from a simple breeding stock. The vectors deliver a tamoxifen-inducible and self-inactivating Cre recombinase, conditional bioluminescent and fluorescent proteins and an shRNA component. Following the transduction of somatic cells, tumours are initiated by Cre-mediated recombination of the inherited floxed alleles. Self-inactivation of Cre expression switches on the expression of luciferase, thereby rendering the recombined cells and resulting tumours bioluminescent. We demonstrate proof of concept of this approach by inducing bioluminescent lung tumours in conditional Kras and p53 mice. We also show that a variant vector expressing shRNA alters tumour growth dynamics and the histological grade associated with the inherited genotype. This approach comprises a versatile means to induce imageable and spontaneous tumour burden in mice. The vectors can be readily customized at the bench to modify reporter readout or tumour phenotype without additional transgenic strain development or breeding. They should also be useful for inducing imageable tumours in organs other than the lung, provided that the inherited conditional genotype is sufficiently penetrant. © 2013 The Authors.

We used cell-attached recording with a glass electrode, a method for which single-unit isolation does not depend on neuronal activity, to quantify the fraction of neurons engaged by acoustic stimuli (tones, frequency modulated sweeps, white-noise bursts, and natural stimuli) in the primary auditory cortex of awake head-fixed rats.

In ', ', it has been shown that normal and transformed cells often compete with each other for survival in an epithelial tissue, in a process called “cell competition.” Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) is a tumor suppressor protein in flies and mammals. Using biochemical methods, we identified Mahjong as a novel binding partner of Lgl in flies and mammals. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Mahjong is involved in cell competition in both flies and mammals. In particular, we found that canine kidney epithelial cells depleted for Mahjong undergo apoptosis, but only when surrounded by non-transformed cells. This represents the first evidence that cell competition can occur in a mammalian cell culture system. Although it is not clear at present what molecules/signaling pathways are regulated by Lgl/Mahjong during cell competition, future studies might reveal important pathway components that could be targeted therapeutically to prevent tumor cells from “winning” in their race against normal tissue cells.']",[],0.0,138.0

We present an analysis of the genome of the centipede ', '. It retains a compact genome that has undergone less gene loss and shuffling than previously sequenced arthropods, and many orthologues of genes conserved from the bilaterian ancestor that have been lost in insects. Our analysis locates many genes in conserved macro-synteny contexts, and many small-scale examples of gene clustering.

The insect olfactory receptor gene family is absent from ', ', and olfaction in air is likely effected by expansion of other receptor gene families.

Whether and how GABAergic inhibition influences STDP is not well understood. Using a model neuron driven by converging inputs modifiable by STDP, we determined that a sufficient level of inhibition was critical to ensure that temporal coherence (correlation among presynaptic spike times) of synaptic inputs, rather than initial strength or number of inputs within a pathway, controlled postsynaptic spike timing. Inhibition exerted this effect by preferentially reducing synaptic efficacy, the ability of inputs to evoke postsynaptic action potentials, of the less coherent inputs. In visual cortical slices, inhibition potently reduced synaptic efficacy at ages during but not before the critical period of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity. Whole-cell recordings revealed that the amplitude of unitary IPSCs from parvalbumin positive (Pv+) interneurons to pyramidal neurons increased during the critical period, while the synaptic decay time-constant decreased. In addition, intrinsic properties of Pv+ interneurons matured, resulting in an increase in instantaneous firing rate. Our results suggest that maturation of inhibition in visual cortex ensures that the temporally coherent inputs (e.g. those from the open eye during monocular deprivation) control postsynaptic spike times of binocular neurons, a prerequisite for Hebbian mechanisms to induce OD plasticity.', 'Evidence suggests that maturation of inhibition is required for the development of plasticity to proceed in the visual cortex. However, the mechanisms by which increased inhibition promotes plasticity are not clear. Here we characterized the maturation of synaptic and intrinsic ionic properties of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, a prominent subtype of inhibitory neuron in the cortex. We used a simple integrate-and-fire model to simulate the influence of maturation of inhibition on associative plasticity rules. We simulated two input pathways that converged onto a single postsynaptic neuron. The temporal pattern of activity was constructed differently for the two pathways: one pathway represented visually-driven activity, while the other pathway represented sensory-deprived activity. In mature circuits it is established that postsynaptic cells can select for sensory-driven inputs over deprived inputs, even in the case that deprived inputs have an initial advantage in synaptic size or number. We demonstrated that maturation of inhibition was required for postsynaptic cells to appropriately select sensory-driven patterns of activity when challenged with an opponent pathway of greater size. These results outline a mechanism by which maturation of inhibition can promote plasticity in the young, a period of development that is characterized by heightened learning.']",[],0.0,42.0

An extensively validated principle called guilt by association states that genes which are associated or interacting are more likely to share function. Guilt by association provides the central top-down principle for analyzing gene networks in functional terms or assessing their quality in encoding functional information. In this work, we show that functional information within gene networks is typically concentrated in only a very few interactions whose properties cannot be reliably related to the rest of the network. In effect, the apparent encoding of function within networks has been largely driven by outliers whose behaviour cannot even be generalized to individual genes, let alone to the network at large. While experimentalist-driven analysis of interactions may use prior expert knowledge to focus on the small fraction of critically important data, large-scale computational analyses have typically assumed that high-performance cross-validation in a network is due to a generalizable encoding of function. Because we find that gene function is not systemically encoded in networks, but dependent on specific and critical interactions, we conclude it is necessary to focus on the details of how networks encode function and what information computational analyses use to extract functional meaning. We explore a number of consequences of this and find that network structure itself provides clues as to which connections are critical and that systemic properties, such as scale-free-like behaviour, do not map onto the functional connectivity within networks.', 'The analysis of gene function and gene networks is a major theme of post-genome biomedical research. Historically, many attempts to understand gene function leverage a biological principle known as “guilt by association” (GBA). GBA states that genes with related functions tend to share properties such as genetic or physical interactions. In the past ten years, GBA has been scaled up for application to large gene networks, becoming a favored way to grapple with the complex interdependencies of gene functions in the face of floods of genomics and proteomics data. However, there is a growing realization that scaled-up GBA is not a panacea. In this study, we report a precise identification of the limits of GBA and show that it cannot provide a way to understand gene networks in a way that is simultaneously general and useful. Our findings indicate that the assumptions underlying the high-throughput use of gene networks to interpret function are fundamentally flawed, with wide-ranging implications for the interpretation of genome-wide data.']",[],0.0,144.0

Unfortunately, even for well-studied species like ', ', only a fraction of all true protein interactions are known, which makes it difficult to reason about the exact flow of signals and the corresponding causal relations in the network. To help address this problem, we introduce a framework for predicting new interactions that aid connectivity between upstream proteins (sources) and downstream transcription factors (targets) of a particular pathway. Our algorithms attempt to globally minimize the distance between sources and targets by finding a small set of shortcut edges to add to the network. Unlike existing algorithms for predicting general protein interactions, by focusing on proteins involved in specific responses our approach homes-in on pathway-consistent interactions. We applied our method to extend pathways in osmotic stress response in yeast and identified several missing interactions, some of which are supported by published reports. We also performed experiments that support a novel interaction not previously reported. Our framework is general and may be applicable to edge prediction problems in other domains.', 'Networks of protein interactions encode a variety of molecular processes occurring in the cell. Embedded within these networks are important subnetworks called signaling pathways. Pathways are initiated by upstream proteins (called sources) that receive signals from the environment and trigger a cascade of information to downstream proteins (targets). Modeling the interactions that occur within this cascade is important because pathway disruption has been linked to several diseases. Further, the interactions help us better understand how cells respond to various conditions and environments. Unfortunately, interaction networks today are largely incomplete, which makes this analysis difficult. We provide a framework to model missing interactions in pathways by searching for interactions that putatively result in quicker and more efficient source-target cascades. We find that we can substantially shorten source-target distances with only a few additional edges and that many of our predicted edges have support in several knowledge databases and literature reports. We believe our approach will be useful to identify interesting and important pathway-centric interactions that have been missed by previous experimental assays.']",[],0.0,28.0

Doing so, we identify the epigenetic marks essential for the bistability of epigenetic states. The model explicitly incorporates two key chromatin marks, namely H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation, and explores whether the presence of multiple marks lead to a qualitatively different systems behavior. We find that having both modifications is important for the robustness of epigenetic silencing. Besides the silenced and transcriptionally active fate of chromatin, our model leads to a novel state with bivalent (i.e., both active and silencing) marks under certain perturbations (knock-out mutations, inhibition or enhancement of enzymatic activity). The bivalent state appears under several perturbations and is shown to result in patchy silencing. We also show that the titration effect, owing to a limited supply of silencing proteins, can result in counter-intuitive responses. The design principles of the silencing system is systematically investigated and disparate experimental observations are assessed within a single theoretical framework. Specifically, we discuss the behavior of Sir protein recruitment, spreading and stability of silenced regions in commonly-studied mutants (e.g., ', '\n', ', ', '\n', ') illuminating the controversial role of Dot1 in the systems biology of yeast silencing.', 'Epigenetics is the study of heritable phenotypic variations that are not caused by changes in the genotype. Silent Information Regulator (SIR) silencing in budding yeast is an important model system for epigenetics. The standard model of silencing relies on feedback, mediated by chromatin modifications (for example, deacetylation of histone residues) which lead to enhanced recruitment of chromatin modifiers. However, the SIR mechanism is not completely understood and it is important to investigate whether as-yet-undiscovered components alter the systems design in a fundamental way. We address this question using minimal models constructed from experimentally known interactions. Rather than building a detailed network model with parameters to fit for quantitative predictions, we build an effective model and study its bifurcation diagram which leads to robust qualitative predictions on the nature of mutants. This minimal modeling delineates a phase space with qualitatively different epigenetic mechanisms and states; some of which arise from drug/genetic perturbations and exhibit large cell-to-cell variation in chromatin marks. Our methodology can be applied to the study of epigenetic chromatin silencing in other model systems, especially Polycomb silencing, and reveals engineering principles that may be of broad relevance.']",[],0.0,11.0

The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new lineage- and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of ∼16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR<0.05), according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. As in previous studies, the identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible “selection histories” of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. A detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.', 'Populations evolve as mutations arise in individual organisms and, through hereditary transmission, gradually become “fixed” (shared by all individuals) in the population. Many mutations have essentially no effect on organismal fitness and can become fixed only by the stochastic process of neutral drift. However, some mutations produce a selective advantage that boosts their chances of reaching fixation. Genes in which new mutations tend to be beneficial, rather than neutral or deleterious, tend to evolve rapidly and are said to be under positive selection. Genes involved in immunity and defense are a well-known example; rapid evolution in these genes presumably occurs because new mutations help organisms to prevail in evolutionary “arms races” with pathogens. Many mammalian genes show evidence of positive selection, but open questions remain about the overall impact of positive selection in mammals. For example, which key differences between species can be attributed to positive selection? How have patterns of selection changed across the mammalian phylogeny?

It is believed that the DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly process plays an important role in such inheritance as well as maintenance of genome stability. In this process, histone chaperones such as chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) deposit newly synthesized histones H3–H4, which are acetylated at specific lysine residues, onto replicating DNA in a PCNA dependent reaction.

For this purpose, we constructed a genome-wide, high-resolution optical map of the maize inbred line B73 genome containing >91,000 restriction sites (averaging 1 site/∼23 kb) accrued from mapping genomic DNA molecules. Our optical map comprises 66 contigs, averaging 31.88 Mb in size and spanning 91.5% (2,103.93 Mb/∼2,300 Mb) of the maize genome.

The integration of optical and iMap resources with comparisons to FPC maps enabled a uniquely comprehensive and scalable assessment of a given BAC's sequence assembly, its placement within a FPC contig, and the location of this FPC contig within a chromosome-wide pseudomolecule.

In spite of numerous studies, the relative contributions of the various heterochromatic histone marks to the properties of heterochromatin remain largely undefined. Here, we report that silencing of the fission yeast mating-type cassettes, which are located in a well-characterized heterochromatic region, is hardly affected in cells lacking the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4. We document the existence of a pathway parallel to H3K9me ensuring gene repression in the absence of Clr4 and identify a silencing factor central to this pathway, Clr5. We find that Clr5 controls gene expression at multiple chromosomal locations in addition to affecting the mating-type region. The histone deacetylase Clr6 acts in the same pathway as Clr5, at least for its effects in the mating-type region, and on a subset of other targets, notably a region recently found to be prone to neo-centromere formation. The genomic targets of Clr5 also include Ste11, a master regulator of sexual differentiation. Hence Clr5, like the multi-functional Atf1 transcription factor which also modulates chromatin structure in the mating-type region, controls sexual differentiation and genome integrity at several levels. Globally, our results point to histone deacetylases as prominent repressors of gene expression in fission yeast heterochromatin.

In dogs, the domestication bottleneck involved at least a 16-fold reduction in population size, a much more severe bottleneck than estimated previously. A sharp bottleneck in wolves occurred soon after their divergence from dogs, implying that the pool of diversity from which dogs arose was substantially larger than represented by modern wolf populations.

From the perfect matches, a representation of the read coverage per nucleotide along the genome, the variation landscape, is generated. SNVs are then pinpointed as significant changes in coverage and de novo SNVs can be identified with high precision.

We propose this pipeline as a useful tool for different genomic applications.', 'The precise determination of de novo genetic variants has enormous implications across different fields of biology and medicine, particularly personalized medicine. Currently, de novo variations are identified by mapping sample reads from a parent–offspring trio to a reference genome, allowing for a certain degree of differences. While widely used, this approach often introduces false-positive (FP) results due to misaligned reads and mischaracterized sequencing errors. In a previous study, we developed an alternative approach to accurately identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using only perfect matches.

COBASI identifies SNVs using changes in coverage of exactly matching unique substrings, and is particularly suited for pinpointing de novo SNVs. Unlike other approaches that require population frequencies across hundreds of samples to filter out any methodological biases, COBASI can be applied to detect de novo SNVs within isolated families. We demonstrate this capability through extensive simulation studies and by studying a parent–offspring trio we sequenced using short reads.

Previous attempts to reconcile neuroanatomical nomenclatures have been largely qualitative, focusing on the development of thesauri or simple semantic mappings between terms. Here we take a fundamentally different approach, discounting the names of regions and instead comparing their definitions as spatial entities in an effort to provide more precise quantitative mappings between anatomical entities as defined by different atlases. We develop an analytical framework for studying this brain atlas concordance problem, and apply these methods in a comparison of eight diverse labeling methods used by the neuroimaging community. These analyses result in conditional probabilities that enable mapping between regions across atlases, which also form the input to graph-based methods for extracting higher-order relationships between sets of regions and to procedures for assessing the global similarity between different parcellations of the same brain. At a global scale, the overall results demonstrate a considerable lack of concordance between available parcellation schemes, falling within chance levels for some atlas pairs. At a finer level, this study reveals spatial relationships between sets of defined regions that are not obviously apparent; these are of high potential interest to researchers faced with the challenge of comparing results that were based on these different anatomical models, particularly when coordinate-based data are not available. The complexity of the spatial overlap patterns revealed points to problems for attempts to reconcile anatomical parcellations and nomenclatures using strictly qualitative and/or categorical methods.

Such differences in network architecture have been reported both at rest and during cognitive task performance, but an open question is whether these age-related differences show task-dependent effects or represent only task-independent changes attributable to a common factor (i.e., underlying physiological decline). To address this question, we used graph theoretic analysis to construct weighted cortical functional networks from hemodynamic (functional MRI) responses in 12 younger and 12 older adults during a speech perception task performed in both quiet and noisy listening conditions. Functional networks were constructed for each subject and listening condition based on inter-regional correlations of the fMRI signal among 66 cortical regions, and network measures of global and local efficiency were computed. Across listening conditions, older adult networks showed significantly decreased global (but not local) efficiency relative to younger adults after normalizing measures to surrogate random networks. Although listening condition produced no main effects on whole-cortex network organization, a significant age group x listening condition interaction was observed. Additionally, an exploratory analysis of regional effects uncovered age-related declines in both global and local efficiency concentrated exclusively in auditory areas (bilateral superior and middle temporal cortex), further suggestive of specificity to the speech perception tasks. Global efficiency also correlated positively with mean cortical thickness across all subjects, establishing gross cortical atrophy as a task-independent contributor to age-related differences in functional organization. Together, our findings provide evidence of age-related disruptions in cortical functional network organization during speech perception tasks, and suggest that although task-independent effects such as cortical atrophy clearly underlie age-related changes in cortical functional organization, age-related differences also demonstrate sensitivity to task domains.']",[],0.0,16.0

By comparing 2× assemblies with high-quality sequences from the ENCODE regions, we estimate the rate of sequencing error to be 1–4 errors per kilobase. While this error rate is fairly modest, sequencing error can still have surprising effects. For example, an apparent lineage-specific insertion in a coding region is more likely to reflect sequencing error than a true biological event, and the length distribution of coding indels is strongly distorted by error. We find that most errors are contributed by a small fraction of bases with low quality scores, in particular, by the ends of reads in regions of single-read coverage in the assembly. We explore several approaches for automatic sequencing error mitigation (SEM), making use of the localized nature of sequencing error, the fact that it is well predicted by quality scores, and information about errors that comes from comparisons across species. Our automatic methods for error mitigation cannot replace the need for additional sequencing, but they do allow substantial fractions of errors to be masked or eliminated at the cost of modest amounts of over-correction, and they can reduce the impact of error in downstream phylogenomic analyses.

In this paper we show that multifunctionality, rather than association, is a primary driver of gene function prediction. We first show that knowledge of the degree of multifunctionality alone can produce astonishingly strong performance when used as a predictor of gene function. We then demonstrate how multifunctionality is encoded in gene interaction data (such as protein interactions and coexpression networks) and how this can feed forward into gene function prediction algorithms. We find that high-quality gene function predictions can be made using data that possesses no information on which gene interacts with which. By examining a wide range of networks from mouse, human and yeast, as well as multiple prediction methods and evaluation metrics, we provide evidence that this problem is pervasive and does not reflect the failings of any particular algorithm or data type.

However, the mechanism by which multisensory information facilitates motor responses is not yet understood. Here, we demonstrate that multisensory information modulates competition among SC neurons to elicit faster responses. We conducted multiunit recordings from the SC of rats performing a two-alternative spatial discrimination task using auditory and/or visual stimuli. We found that a large population of SC neurons showed direction-selective activity before the onset of movement in response to the stimuli irrespective of stimulation modality. Trial-by-trial correlation analysis showed that the premovement activity of many SC neurons increased with faster reaction speed for the contraversive movement, whereas the premovement activity of another population of neurons decreased with faster reaction speed for the ipsiversive movement. When visual and auditory stimuli were presented simultaneously, the premovement activity of a population of neurons for the contraversive movement was enhanced, whereas the premovement activity of another population of neurons for the ipsiversive movement was depressed. Unilateral inactivation of SC using muscimol prolonged reaction times of contraversive movements, but it shortened those of ipsiversive movements. These findings suggest that the difference in activity between the SC hemispheres regulates the reaction speed of motor responses, and multisensory information enlarges the activity difference resulting in faster responses.']",[],0.0,27.0

Narrow genetic diversity in cultivated germplasm has further hampered the effective utilization of conventional breeding as well as development and utilization of genomic tools, resulting in pigeonpea being often referred to as an ‘orphan crop legume’. To enable genomics-assisted breeding in this crop, the pigeonpea genomics initiative (PGI) was initiated in late 2006 with funding from Indian Council of Agricultural Research under the umbrella of Indo-US agricultural knowledge initiative, which was further expanded with financial support from the US National Science Foundation’s Plant Genome Research Program and the Generation Challenge Program. As a result of the PGI, the last 3\xa0years have witnessed significant progress in development of both genetic as well as genomic resources in this crop through effective collaborations and coordination of genomics activities across several institutes and countries. For instance, 25 mapping populations segregating for a number of biotic and abiotic stresses have been developed or are under development. An 11X-genome coverage bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library comprising of 69,120 clones have been developed of which 50,000 clones were end sequenced to generate 87,590 BAC-end sequences (BESs).

Of about 21,000 SSRs identified, 6,698 SSRs are under analysis along with 670 orthologous genes using a GoldenGate SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping platform, with large scale SNP discovery using Solexa, a next generation sequencing technology, is in progress. Similarly a diversity array technology array comprising of ca. 15,000 features has been developed.

We selected 30 androgen-dependent alternative events for RT-PCR validation, including mRNAs derived from genes encoding tumour suppressors and cell cycle regulators. Of seven positively-validating events (∼23%), five events involved transcripts derived from alternative promoters of known AR gene targets. In particular, we found a novel androgen-dependent mRNA isoform derived from an alternative internal promoter within the ', ' tumour suppressor gene, which is predicted to encode a protein lacking an interaction domain required for mTOR inhibition. We confirmed that expression of this alternative TSC2 mRNA isoform was directly regulated by androgens, and chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated recruitment of AR to the alternative promoter region at early timepoints following androgen stimulation, which correlated with expression of alternative transcripts. Together, our data suggest that alternative mRNA isoform expression might mediate the cellular response to androgens, and may have roles in clinical PCa.']",[],0.0,33.0

Because of the voltage- and time-dependent conductances in the dendrites and soma, summation of synaptic inputs is complex. To examine summation of membrane potentials and firing rates, we performed whole-cell recordings from layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons in acute slices of the rat's somatosensory cortex. We delivered subthreshold and suprathreshold stimuli at the soma and several sites on the apical dendrite, and injected inputs that mimic synaptic barrages at individual or distributed sites. We found that summation of subthreshold potentials differed from that of firing rates. Subthreshold summation was linear when barrages were small but became supralinear as barrages increased. When neurons were discharging repetitively the rules were more diverse. At the soma and proximal apical dendrite summation of the evoked firing rates was predominantly sublinear whereas in the distal dendrite summation ranged from supralinear to sublinear. In addition, the integration of inputs delivered at a single location differed from that of distributed inputs only for suprathreshold responses. These results indicate that convergent inputs onto the apical dendrite and soma do not simply summate linearly, as suggested previously, and that distinct presynaptic afferents that target specific sites on the dendritic tree may perform unique sets of computations.""]",[],0.0,7.0

This cooperation required the ability of ErbB2 to regulate the Par6/aPKC polarity complex. Inhibition of the ErbB2-Par6 pathway was sufficient to block ErbB2-induced invasion suggesting that two polarity hits may be needed for ErbB2 to promote invasion. Interestingly, in the absence of ErbB2 activation, either a combined loss of two polarity proteins, or exposure of cells lacking one polarity protein to cytokines IL-6 or TNF', ' induced invasive behavior in epithelial cells. We observed the invasive behavior only when cells were plated on a stiff matrix (Matrigel/Collagen-1) and not when plated on a soft matrix (Matrigel alone).

Inhibition of Akt activity blocked the invasive behavior identifying a mechanism by which loss of polarity promotes invasion of epithelial cells.

From early-branching metazoa to humans, we found that a core domain, comprising a tetrad of C2H2 zinc fingers, is conserved.

Here we’ve addressed this on a genome-wide scale for cancer-associated focal deletions, which are known to pinpoint both tumor suppressor genes (tumor suppressors) and unstable loci.

Genome-wide analysis revealed properties of CFS-like recurrent deletions that distinguish them from deletions affecting tumor suppressor genes, including their isolation at specific loci away from other genomic deletion sites, a considerably smaller deletion size, and dispersal throughout the affected locus rather than assembly at a common site of overlap. Additionally, CFS-like deletions have less impact on gene expression and are enriched in cell lines compared to primary tumors. We show that loci affected by CFS-like deletions are often distinct from known common fragile sites. Indeed, we find that each tumor tissue type has its own spectrum of CFS-like deletions, and that colon cancers have many more CFS-like deletions than other tumor types.

WNT3 suppresses GCP growth through a non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, activating prototypic mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the Ras-dependent extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and ERK5, instead of the classical β-catenin pathway. Inhibition of MAPK activity using a MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of WNT3 on GCP proliferation. Importantly, WNT3 inhibits proliferation of medulloblastoma tumor growth in mouse models by a similar mechanism. Thus, the present study suggests a novel role for WNT3 as a regulator of neurogenesis and repressor of neural tumors.']",[],0.0,58.0

Recently, we revealed a novel role for Fkh1 and Fkh2 in the regulation of replication origin initiation timing, which, like donor preference in mating-type switching, appears to involve long-range chromosomal interactions, suggesting roles for Fkh1 and Fkh2 in chromatin architecture and organization. To elucidate how Fkh1 and Fkh2 regulate their target DNA elements and potentially regulate the spatial organization of the genome, we undertook a genome-wide analysis of Fkh1 and Fkh2 chromatin binding by ChIP-chip using tiling DNA microarrays.

In addition, the data reveal hundreds of novel loci that bind Fkh1 only and exhibit a distinct chromatin structure from loci that bind both Fkh1 and Fkh2.

Using biochemical and proteomic approaches, we have found that Vpx protein of the pathogenic SIVmac 239 strain associates with a ternary protein complex comprising DDB1 and VprBP subunits of Cullin 4–based E3 ubiquitin ligase, and DDA1, which has been implicated in the regulation of E3 catalytic activity, and that Vpx participates in the Cullin 4 E3 complex comprising VprBP.

The Glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) is a key molecule in HH signaling, acting as a transcriptional effector and, moreover, is considered to be a potential therapeutic target for several types of cancer. To extend our previous focus on the implications of alternative splicing for HH signal transduction, we now report on an additional post-transcriptional mechanism with an impact on GLI1 activity, namely RNA editing. The GLI1 mRNA is highly edited at nucleotide 2179 by adenosine deamination in normal cerebellum, but the extent of this modification is reduced in cell lines from the cerebellar tumor medulloblastoma. Additionally, basal cell carcinoma tumor samples exhibit decreased GLI1 editing compared with normal skin. Interestingly, knocking down of either ADAR1 or ADAR2 reduces RNA editing of GLI1. This adenosine to inosine substitution leads to a change from Arginine to Glycine at position 701 that influences not only GLI1 transcriptional activity, but also GLI1-dependent cellular proliferation. Specifically, the edited GLI1, GLI1-701G, has a higher capacity to activate most of the transcriptional targets tested and is less susceptible to inhibition by the negative regulator of HH signaling suppressor of fused. However, the Dyrk1a kinase, implicated in cellular proliferation, is more effective in increasing the transcriptional activity of the non-edited GLI1. Finally, introduction of GLI1-701G into medulloblastoma cells confers a smaller increase in cellular growth relative to GLI1. In conclusion, our findings indicate that RNA editing of GLI1 is a regulatory mechanism that modulates the output of the HH signaling pathway.']",[],0.0,61.0

However, the precise network structure that integrates these four projections remains poorly understood. Here, we constructed a whole-brain, three-dimensional (3D) map showing the tract pathways and targeting locations of these four motor cortical outputs in mice.

In data from M1 of two monkeys, we did not find evidence for this hypothesis: few neurons exhibited a clear pause during movement, and these were at the tail end of a broad distribution.

Concordance was defined as the proportion of observations that simultaneously fall in the component with the higher mean or simultaneously in the component with the lower mean based on their Bayesian posterior probabilities. These trios and quartets have a concordance rate greater than 80%. There are 33 genes involved in these trios and quartets. A factor analysis with varimax rotation identifies three gene groups based on their factor loadings. One group of 18 genes has a concordance rate of 56.7%, another group of 8 genes has a concordance rate of 60.8%, and a third group of 7 genes has a concordance rate of 69.6%. Each of these rates is highly significant, suggesting that there may be strong biological underpinnings for the mixture mechanisms of these genes. Bayesian factor screening confirms this hypothesis by identifying six single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are significantly associated with the expression phenotypes of the five most concordant genes in the first group.']",[],0.0,

Of these possibilities, the gain of function (GOF) hypothesis is the most controversial, in part due to the dizzying array of biological functions that have been attributed to different mutant p53 proteins. Herein we discuss the current state of understanding of ', ' allele variation in cancer and recent reports that both support and challenge the p53 GOF model. In these studies and others, researchers are turning to more systematic approaches to profile ', ' mutations, which may ultimately determine once and for all how different ', ' mutations act as cancer drivers and whether tumors harboring distinct mutations are phenotypically unique. From a clinical perspective, such information could lead to new therapeutic approaches targeting the effects of different ', ' alleles and/or better sub-stratification of patients harboring ', ' mutant cancers.']",[],0.0,24.0

However, the payload capacity of <4.9\u2009kb limits the transfer of large or multiple genes. Oversized payloads could be delivered by fragmenting the transgenes into separate AAV capsids that are then mixed. This strategy could increase the AAV cargo capacity to treat monogenic, polygenic diseases and comorbidities only if controlled co-expression of multiple AAV capsids is achieved on each transduced cell. We developed a tool to quantify the number of incoming AAV genomes that are co-expressed in the nervous system with single-cell resolution. By using an isogenic mix of three AAVs each expressing single fluorescent reporters, we determined that expression of much greater than 31 AAV genomes per neuron in vitro and 20 genomes per neuron in vivo is obtained across different brain regions including anterior cingulate, prefrontal, somatomotor and somatosensory cortex areas, and cerebellar lobule VI. Our results demonstrate that multiple AAV vectors containing different transgenes or transgene fragments, can efficiently co-express in the same neuron.

Specifically, animals are born with highly structured brain connectivity, which enables them to learn very rapidly. Because the wiring diagram is far too complex to be specified explicitly in the genome, it must be compressed through a “genomic bottleneck”. The genomic bottleneck suggests a path toward ANNs capable of rapid learning.', 'Recent gains in artificial neural networks rely heavily on large amounts of training data.

The genomic distribution profiles, primary binding motifs, chromatin states, and DNA methylation preferences are well conserved for TF-occupied sequences. However, the extent to which orthologous DNA segments are bound by orthologous TFs varies both among TFs and with genomic location: binding at promoters is more highly conserved than binding at distal elements.

Our survey of miRNA populations in each sex identifies sets of miRNAs differentially expressed in male and female tissues across various stages of development. The pervasive sex-biased expression of miRNAs generally increases with the complexity and sexual dimorphism of tissues, gonads revealing the most striking biases. We find that the male-specific regulation of the X chromosome is relevant to miRNA expression on two levels. First, in the male gonad, testis-biased miRNAs tend to reside on the X chromosome. Second, in the soma, X-linked miRNAs do not systematically rely on dosage compensation. We set out to address the importance of a sex-biased expression of miRNAs in establishing sexually dimorphic traits. Our study of the conserved let-7-C miRNA cluster controlled by the sex-biased hormone ecdysone places let-7 as a primary modulator of the sex-determination hierarchy. Flies with modified let-7 levels present doublesex-related phenotypes and express sex-determination genes normally restricted to the opposite sex. In testes and ovaries, alterations of the ecdysone-induced let-7 result in aberrant gonadal somatic cell behavior and non-cell-autonomous defects in early germline differentiation. Gonadal defects as well as aberrant expression of sex-determination genes persist in aging adults under hormonal control. Together, our findings place ecdysone and let-7 as modulators of a somatic systemic signal that helps establish and sustain sexual identity in males and females and differentiation in gonads.

It therefore represents a crucial regulator of the cellular defense mechanisms against xenobiotic and oxidative stress. In addition to antioxidant responses, Nrf2 is involved in other cellular processes, such as autophagy, intermediary metabolism, stem cell quiescence, and unfolded protein response. Given the wide range of processes that Nrf2 controls, its activity is tightly regulated at multiple levels. Here, we review the different modes of regulation of Nrf2 activity and the current knowledge of Nrf2-mediated transcriptional control.', ' It is now clear that Nrf2 lies at the center of a complex regulatory network. A full comprehension of the Nrf2 program will require an integrated consideration of all the different factors determining Nrf2 activity.', ' Additional computational and experimental studies are needed to obtain a more dynamic global view of Nrf2-mediated gene regulation. In particular, studies comparing how the Nrf2-dependent network changes from a physiological to a pathological condition can provide insight into mechanisms of disease and instruct new treatment strategies.']",[],0.0,1029.0

In this article, we describe the development of a quantitative trait loci (QTL) database and illustrate how it can be used to facilitate both the forward and reverse genetics research. The QTL database contains the largest online collection of rice QTL data in the world. Using flanking markers as anchors, QTLs originally reported on individual genetic maps have been systematically aligned to the rice sequence where they can be searched as standard genomic features. Researchers can determine whether a QTL co-localizes with other QTLs detected in independent experiments and can combine data from multiple studies to improve the resolution of a QTL position. Candidate genes falling within a QTL interval can be identified and their relationship to particular phenotypes can be inferred based on functional annotations provided by ontology terms. Mutations identified in functional genomics populations and association mapping panels can be aligned with QTL regions to facilitate fine mapping and validation of gene–phenotype associations. By assembling and integrating diverse types of data and information across species and levels of biological complexity, the QTL database enhances the potential to understand and utilize QTL information in biological research.']",[],0.0,66.0

Following DE-pairing, the density of axons in supragranular layers projecting from the labeled neurons in the D2 column was higher in E- than in C-row columns. This asymmetry resulted primarily from a reduction in projection density toward the deprived C-row columns. In contrast, no change was observed in infragranular layers.

MK-STYX is catalytically inactive due to the absence of two amino acids from the signature motif that are essential for phosphatase activity. The nucleophilic cysteine residue and the adjacent histidine residue, which are conserved in all active dual-specificity phosphatases, are replaced by serine and phenylalanine residues respectively in MK-STYX. Mutations to introduce histidine and cysteine residues into the active site of MK-STYX generated an active phosphatase. Using MS, we identified G3BP1 [Ras-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) SH3 (Src homology 3) domain-binding protein-1], a regulator of Ras signalling, as a binding partner of MK-STYX. We observed that G3BP1 bound to native MK-STYX; however, binding to the mutant catalytically active form of MK-STYX was dramatically reduced. G3BP1 is also an RNA-binding protein with endoribonuclease activity that is recruited to ‘stress granules’ after stress stimuli. Stress granules are large subcellular structures that serve as sites of mRNA sorting, in which untranslated mRNAs accumulate. We have shown that expression of MK-STYX inhibited stress granule formation induced either by aresenite or expression of G3BP itself; however, the catalytically active mutant MK-STYX was impaired in its ability to inhibit G3BP-induced stress granule assembly. These results reveal a novel facet of the function of a member of the PTP family, illustrating a role for MK-STYX in regulating the ability of G3BP1 to integrate changes in growth-factor stimulation and environmental stress with the regulation of protein synthesis.']",[],0.0,36.0

Using two-photon laser-scanning microscopy and biolistic gene delivery of GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged constructs into organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we have developed an assay of PTEN function in living tissue. Using this bioassay, we have demonstrated that overexpression of wild-type PTEN led to a decrease in spine density in neurons. Furthermore, it was the protein phosphatase activity, but not the lipid phosphatase activity, of PTEN that was essential for this effect. The ability of PTEN to decrease neuronal spine density depended upon the phosphorylation status of serine and threonine residues in its C-terminal segment and the integrity of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. The present study reveals a new aspect of the function of this important tumour suppressor and suggest that, in addition to dephosphorylating the 3 position in phosphatidylinositol phospholipids, the critical protein substrate of PTEN may be PTEN itself.']",[],0.0,82.0

Investigation of CNV–SNP linkage disequilibrium (LD) for 500–900 bi- and multi-allelic CNVs per population revealed that previous conflicting reports on bi-allelic LD were unexpectedly consistent and explained by an LD increase correlated with deletion-allele frequencies.

We develop the hypothesis that emotions are the product of neural computations whose motor role is to reallocate bodily resources mostly gated by smooth muscles. This “emotor” control system is analagous to the more familiar motor control computations that coordinate skeletal muscle movements. To illustrate this framework, we review recent research on “confidence.” Although familiar as a feeling, confidence is also an objective statistical quantity: an estimate of the probability that a hypothesis is correct. This model-based approach helped reveal the neural basis of decision confidence in mammals and provides a bridge to the subjective feeling of confidence in humans. These results have important implications for psychiatry, since disorders of confidence computations appear to contribute to a number of psychopathologies.

In females, darting exhibits the characteristics of a learned fear behavior, appearing during the CS period as conditioning proceeds and disappearing from the CS period during extinction. This finding motivates a reinterpretation of rodent fear conditioning studies, particularly in females, and it suggests that conditioned fear behavior is more diverse than previously appreciated.

The experiments used a technique called cued fear conditioning, which pairs a sound with a mild electrical shock to a foot. When rats learn that the sound predicts the shock, the sound alone causes them to produce a fear response.

Studying how individual decisions unfold requires moment-by-moment readouts of brain state. Here we provide such a view from dorsal premotor and primary motor cortex. Two monkeys performed a novel decision task while we recorded from many neurons simultaneously. We found that a decoder trained using ‘forced choices’ (one target viable) was highly reliable when applied to ‘free choices’. However, during free choices internal events formed three categories. Typically, neural activity was consistent with rapid, unwavering choices. Sometimes, though, we observed presumed ‘changes of mind’: the neural state initially reflected one choice before changing to reflect the final choice. Finally, we observed momentary ‘indecision’: delay forming any clear motor plan. Further, moments of neural indecision accompanied moments of behavioral indecision. Together, these results reveal the rich and diverse set of internal events long suspected to occur during free choice.', '\n', 'Some decisions are easy to make. We know almost immediately what outcome we want to achieve and what actions are required to do so.

Instead, those experiments have measured the average brain response over multiple decisions because they lacked the power to detect what happened on each individual decision.

Moreover, these patterns of neural activity reflected whether the monkey responded immediately or hesitated, made a firm choice or wavered, or stuck to his original choice or changed his mind.', 'While behaviours such as hesitation and wavering feel intuitively familiar, this is the first time that they have been observed at the neural level.

These inputs are likely to shape the activity of each type (that is, their ‘message’ to the rest of the brain). The mapping revealed that most dopamine neurons do not receive substantial input from the area to which they project (i.e., they do not form ‘closed loops’). Instead, most of their input comes from a common set of brain regions, including a particularly large number of inputs from the ventral striatum.', ""However, Menegas et al. found one exception.

Here, we present TEsmall, a tool that allows for the simultaneous processing and analysis of sRNAs from each annotated class in a single integrated workflow. The pipeline begins with raw fastq reads and proceeds all the way to producing count tables formatted for differential expression analysis. Several interactive charts are also produced to look at overall distributions in length and annotation classes. We next applied the TEsmall pipeline to sRNA libraries generated from melanoma cells responding to targeted inhibitors of the MAPK pathway. Targeted oncogene inhibitors have emerged as way to tailor cancer therapies to the particular mutations present in a given tumor. While these targeted strategies are typically effective for short intervals, the emergence of resistance is extremely common, limiting the effectiveness of single-agent therapeutics and driving the need for a better understanding of resistance mechanisms. Using TEsmall, we identified several microRNAs and other sRNA classes that are enriched in inhibitor resistant melanoma cells in multiple melanoma cell lines and may be able to serve as markers of resistant populations more generally.']",[],0.0,4.0

Both systems produce a fraction of viral particles that can propagate beyond the primary infected neuron.

Many, if not all these systems, become altered throughout the course of cancer initiation, growth, metastatic spread, treatment, and recurrence. Recent work has demonstrated how changes in sleep influence the development of chronic diseases, including cancer, in both humans and animal models. A common finding is that for some cancers (e.g., breast), chronic disruption of sleep/wake states prior to disease onset is associated with an increased risk for cancer development. Additionally, sleep disruption after cancer initiation is often associated with worse outcomes. Recently, evidence suggesting that cancer itself can affect neuronal circuits controlling sleep and wakefulness has accumulated.

BEDMR loci are further associated with local hypomethylation (66%), concentrations of the Alu SINE repeats within 3\u2009Mb (35% of the cases), and tend to occur near a number of cancer related genes such as the protocadherins, AKT1, DUB3, GAB2. Furthermore, BEDMRs seem to deregulate members of the histone gene family and chromatin remodeling factors, e.g., JMJD1B, which might affect the chromatin structure and disrupt coordinate signaling and repair.

PNs from anatomically distinct tracts respond to the same stimulus space, but have different physiological properties, characteristics that are prerequisites for parallel processing of different stimulus aspects. However, the PN pathways also display mirror-imaged like anatomical trajectories that resemble neuronal coincidence detectors as known from auditory delay lines. To investigate temporal processing of olfactory information, we recorded PN odor responses simultaneously from both tracts and measured coincident activity of PNs within and between tracts. Our results show that coincidence levels are different within each of the two tracts. Coincidence also occurs between tracts, but to a minor extent compared to coincidence within tracts. Taken together our findings support the relevance of spike timing in coding of olfactory information (temporal code).']",[],0.0,12.0

In particular, most sequences that are sufficiently stable to fold will have stabilities near the folding threshold. Here, we extend this argument to consider its predictions for epistatic interactions for the effects of mutations on the free energy of folding. Although there is abundant evidence to indicate that the effects of mutations on the free energy of folding are nearly additive and conserved over evolutionary time, we show that these observations are compatible with the hypothesis that a non-additive contribution to the folding free energy is essential for observed proteins to maintain their native structure. In particular, through both simulations and analytical results, we show that even very small departures from additivity are sufficient to drive this effect.']",[],0.0,5.0

Sex differences in the brain appear throughout the animal kingdom and are largely a consequence of the physiological requirements necessary for the distinct roles of the two sexes in reproduction. As with the rest of the body, gonadal steroid hormones act to specify and regulate many of these differences. It is thought that transient hormonal signaling during brain development gives rise to persistent sex differences in gene expression via an epigenetic mechanism, leading to divergent neurodevelopmental trajectories that may underlie sex differences in disease susceptibility. However, few genes with a persistent sex difference in expression have been identified, and only a handful of studies have employed genome-wide approaches to assess sex differences in epigenomic modifications. To date, there are no confirmed examples of gene regulatory elements that direct sex differences in gene expression in the brain. Here, we review foundational studies in this field, describe transcriptional mechanisms that could act downstream of hormone receptors in the brain, and suggest future approaches for identification and validation of sex-typical gene programs. We propose that sexual differentiation of the brain involves self-perpetuating transcriptional states that canalize sex-specific development.']",[],0.0,22.0

To understand the nature of heteroplasmy, we developed Mseek, a novel technique to purify and sequence mtDNA. Mseek yields high purity (>90%) mtDNA and its ability to detect rare variants is limited only by sequencing depth, providing unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. Using Mseek, we confirmed the ubiquity of heteroplasmy by analyzing mtDNA from a diverse set of cell lines and human samples. Applying Mseek to colonies derived from single cells, we find heteroplasmy is stably maintained in individual daughter cells over multiple cell divisions. We hypothesized that the stability of heteroplasmy could be facilitated by intercellular exchange of mtDNA. We explicitly demonstrate this exchange by co-culturing cell lines with distinct mtDNA haplotypes. Our results shed new light on the maintenance of heteroplasmy and provide a novel platform to investigate features of heteroplasmy in normal and diseased states.']",[],0.0,54.0

PCR is a fundamental step in preparing DNA samples for high-throughput sequencing. However, there are errors associated with PCR-mediated amplification. Here we examine the effects of four important sources of error—bias, stochasticity, template switches and polymerase errors—on sequence representation in low-input next-generation sequencing libraries. We designed a pool of diverse PCR amplicons with a defined structure, and then used Illumina sequencing to search for signatures of each process. We further developed quantitative models for each process, and compared predictions of these models to our experimental data. We find that PCR stochasticity is the major force skewing sequence representation after amplification of a pool of unique DNA amplicons. Polymerase errors become very common in later cycles of PCR but have little impact on the overall sequence distribution as they are confined to small copy numbers. PCR template switches are rare and confined to low copy numbers. Our results provide a theoretical basis for removing distortions from high-throughput sequencing data. In addition, our findings on PCR stochasticity will have particular relevance to quantification of results from single cell sequencing, in which sequences are represented by only one or a few molecules.']",[],0.0,145.0

Unfortunately, sorafenib showed very modest effects in a multi-institutional phase II trial in advanced uterine carcinoma patients. Here, by leveraging RNA-sequencing data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and cell survival studies from compound-based high-throughput screenings we have identified the lysosomal pathway as a potential compartment involved in the resistance to sorafenib.

Specifically, our results indicate that sorafenib triggers a mechanistic MAPK/JNK-dependent early protective autophagic response in EC cells, providing an adaptive response to therapeutic stress. By generating in vivo subcutaneous EC cell line tumors, lung metastatic assays and primary EC orthoxenografts experiments, we demonstrate that targeting autophagy enhances sorafenib cytotoxicity and suppresses tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis progression.

The SPS protocol evoked c-fos expression in several brain regions that control the stress-anxiety response, including the central and medial amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the pallidum, the paraventricular hypothalamus, the intermediodorsal, paraventricular and central medial thalamic nuclei, the periaqueductal gray, the lateral habenula and the cuneiform nucleus. These effects were partially blocked by pretreatment with prazosin but completely prevented by ACH-000029. Collectively, these findings contribute to the brain-wide characterization of neural circuits involved in PTSD-related stress responses. Furthermore, the identification of brain areas regulated by ACH-000029 and prazosin revealed regions in which SPS-induced activation may depend on the combined or isolated action of the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems. Finally, the dual regulation of serotonin and α1 receptors by ACH-000029 might represent a potential pharmacotherapy that can be applied in the peri-trauma or early post-trauma period to mitigate the development of symptoms in PTSD patients.']",[],0.0,9.0

We measured meristem height, width, plastochron internode length, and associated traits from 86 individuals of the intermated B73 × Mo17 recombinant inbred line population.

Many fast-evolving genes and noncoding sequences in the human genome have GC-biased substitution patterns, suggesting that gBGC—in contrast to adaptive processes—may have driven the human changes in these sequences. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed a substitution model for DNA sequence evolution that quantifies the nonlinear interacting effects of selection and gBGC on substitution rates and patterns. Based on this model, we used a series of lineage-specific likelihood ratio tests to evaluate sequence alignments for evidence of changes in mode of selection, action of gBGC, or both. With a false positive rate of less than 5% for individual tests, we found that the majority (76%) of previously identified human accelerated regions are best explained without gBGC, whereas a substantial minority (19%) are best explained by the action of gBGC alone. Further, more than half (55%) have substitution rates that significantly exceed local estimates of the neutral rate, suggesting that these regions may have been shaped by positive selection rather than by relaxation of constraint.

In the brain, homeostatic plasticity represents a set of mechanisms that also stabilize and normalize network activity to lie within certain ranges, and these mechanisms are critical for maintaining normal brain function. In this article, we discuss parallels between artificial and biological normalization methods at four spatial scales: normalization of a single neuron's activity, normalization of synaptic weights of a neuron, normalization of a layer of neurons, and normalization of a network of neurons. We argue that both types of methods are functionally equivalent—that is, both push activation patterns of hidden units toward a homeostatic state, where all neurons are equally used—and we argue that such representations can improve coding capacity, discrimination, and regularization. As a proof of concept, we develop an algorithm, inspired by a neural normalization technique called "", ', and show that this algorithm performs competitively against existing normalization methods on several data sets.

Informed by a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen, we show that trametinib provokes a compensatory response involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) that leads to signaling rebound and adaptive drug resistance. As a consequence, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of FGFR1 in combination with trametinib enhances tumor cell death ', ' and ', '. This compensatory response shows distinct specificities – it is dominated by FGFR1 in KRAS mutant lung and pancreatic cancer cells, but is not activated or involves other mechanisms in KRAS wild-type lung and KRAS-mutant colon cancer cells. Importantly, KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and patient tumors treated with trametinib show an increase in FRS2 phosphorylation, a biomarker of FGFR activation; this increase is abolished by FGFR1 inhibition and correlates with sensitivity to trametinib and FGFR inhibitor combinations.

We analyzed 1645 root architectures from four species and discovered that the spatial density functions of all architectures are population-similar. This means that despite their apparent visual diversity, all of the roots studied share the same basic shape, aside from stretching and compression along orthogonal directions. Moreover, the spatial density of all architectures can be described as variations on a single underlying function: a Gaussian density truncated at a boundary of roughly three standard deviations. Thus, the root density of any architecture requires only four parameters to specify: the total mass of the architecture and the standard deviations of the Gaussian in the three (', ', ', ', ', ') growth directions.

Here we show that CAFs induce NET formation within the tumor and systemically in the blood and bone marrow. These tumor-induced NETs (t-NETs) are driven by a ROS-mediated pathway dependent on CAF-derived Amyloid β, a peptide implicated in both neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders. Inhibition of NETosis in murine tumors skews neutrophils to an anti-tumor phenotype, preventing tumor growth; reciprocally, t-NETs enhance CAF activation. Mirroring observations in mice, CAFs are detected juxtaposed to NETs in human melanoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and show elevated amyloid and β-Secretase expression which correlates with poor prognosis. In summary, we report that CAFs drive NETosis to support cancer progression, identifying Amyloid β as the protagonist and potential therapeutic target.', 'The tumor microenvironment is composed of many cell types that crosstalk to modulate local immunity.

These “inflorescences” arise from stem cell populations in shoot meristems that mature gradually to reproductive states in response to environmental and endogenous signals. The morphology of the shoot meristem maturation process is conserved across distantly related plants, raising the question of how diverse inflorescence architectures arise from seemingly common maturation programs. In tomato and related nightshades (Solanaceae), inflorescences range from solitary flowers to highly branched structures bearing hundreds of flowers. Since reproductive barriers between even closely related Solanaceae have precluded a genetic dissection, we captured and compared meristem maturation transcriptomes from five domesticated and wild species reflecting the evolutionary continuum of inflorescence complexity. We find these divergent species share hundreds of dynamically expressed genes, enriched for transcription factors. Meristem stages are defined by distinct molecular states and point to modified maturation schedules underlying architectural variation. These modified schedules are marked by a peak of transcriptome expression divergence during the reproductive transition, driven by heterochronic shifts of dynamic genes, including transcriptional regulators with known roles in flowering. Thus, evolutionary diversity in Solanaceae inflorescence complexity is determined by subtle modifications of transcriptional programs during a critical transitional window of meristem maturation, which we propose underlies similar cases of plant architectural variation. More broadly, our findings parallel the recently described transcriptome “inverse hourglass” model for animal embryogenesis, suggesting both plant and animal morphological variation is guided by a mid-development period of transcriptome divergence.']",[],,36.0

Nonetheless, Nanopore sequencing devices are limited in the number of retrievable sequencing reads/molecules compared to short-read sequencing platforms, limiting CNA inference accuracy. To address this limitation, we targeted the sequencing of short-length DNA molecules loaded at optimized concentration in an effort to increase sequence read/molecule yield from a single nanopore run. We show that short-molecule nanopore sequencing reproducibly returns high read counts and allows high quality CNA inference. We demonstrate the clinical relevance of this approach by accurately inferring CNAs in acute myeloid leukemia samples. The data shows that, compared to traditional approaches such as chromosome analysis/cytogenetics, short molecule nanopore sequencing returns more sensitive, accurate copy number information in a cost effective and expeditious manner, including for multiplex samples.

Moreover, comparison of transcriptomes between hiPSCs cultured with CCL2 versus with bFGF, we found that CCL2 activates hypoxia related genes, suggesting that CCL2 enhanced pluripotency by inducing a hypoxic-like response. Further, we show that hiPSCs cultured with CCL2 can differentiate at a higher efficiency than culturing with just bFGF and we show CCL2 can be used in feeder-free conditions in the absence of LIF.

Evidence is provided that these miRNAs are expressed at much higher levels than non-testis-specific miRNAs of similar age. They also appear to have greater regulatory capacity than do other young miRNAs.', 'The propensity of animal miRNAs to regulate targets bearing modest complementarity, most notably via pairing with miRNA positions ∼2–8 (the “seed”), is believed to drive major aspects of miRNA evolution. First, minimal targeting requirements have allowed most conserved miRNAs to acquire large target cohorts, thus imposing strong selection on miRNAs to maintain their seed sequences. Second, the modest pairing needed for repression suggests that evolutionarily nascent miRNAs may generally induce net detrimental, rather than beneficial, regulatory effects. Hence, levels and activities of newly emerged miRNAs are expected to be limited to preserve the status quo of gene expression. In this study, we unexpectedly show that ', ' testes specifically express a substantial miRNA population that contravenes these tenets. We find that multiple genomic clusters of testis-restricted miRNAs harbor recently evolved miRNAs, whose experimentally verified orthologs exhibit divergent sequences, even within seed regions. Moreover, this class of miRNAs exhibits higher expression and greater phenotypic capacities in transgenic misexpression assays than do non-testis-restricted miRNAs of similar evolutionary age. These observations suggest that these testis-restricted miRNAs may be evolving adaptively, and several methods of evolutionary analysis provide strong support for this notion. Consistent with this, proof-of-principle tests show that orthologous miRNAs with divergent seeds can distinguish target sensors in a species-cognate manner. Finally, we observe that testis-restricted miRNA clusters exhibit extraordinary dynamics of miRNA gene flux in other ', ' species. Altogether, our findings reveal a surprising tissue-directed influence of miRNA evolution, involving a distinct mode of miRNA function connected to adaptive gene regulation in the testis.']",[],3.0,31.0

We also analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and found that clinically severe cases had viral genomes belonging to all major viral lineages.

First, we show that neural networks implementing Q-learning with motivational salience can navigate in environment with dynamic rewards without adjustments in synaptic strengths when the needs of an agent shift. In this setting, our networks may display elements of addictive behaviors. Second, we use a similar framework in hierarchical manager-agent system to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm with motivation that both infers motivational states and behaves. Finally, we show that, when trained in the Pavlovian conditioning setting, the responses of the neurons in our model resemble previously published neuronal recordings in the ventral pallidum, a basal ganglia structure involved in motivated behaviors. We conclude that motivation allows Q-learning networks to quickly adapt their behavior to conditions when expected reward is modulated by agent’s dynamic needs.

To investigate positive selection on the dog lineage early in the domestication, we examined patterns of polymorphism in six canid genomes that were previously used to infer a demographic model of dog domestication. Using an inferred demographic model, we computed false discovery rates (FDR) and identified 349 outlier regions consistent with positive selection at a low FDR. The signals in the top 100 regions were frequently centered on candidate genes related to brain function and behavior, including ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', and ', '. These regions contained significant enrichments in behavioral ontology categories. The 3', ' top hit, ', ', plays a major role in lipid metabolism, that is supported by additional metabolism related candidates revealed in our scan, including ', ' and ', '. Comparing our method to an empirical outlier approach that does not directly account for demography, we found only modest overlaps between the two methods, with 60% of empirical outliers having no overlap with our demography-based outlier detection approach. Demography-aware approaches have lower-rates of false discovery. Our top candidates for selection, in addition to expanding the set of neurobehavioral candidate genes, include genes related to lipid metabolism, suggesting a dietary target of selection that was important during the period when proto-dogs hunted and fed alongside hunter-gatherers.', 'Identification of the genomic regions under selection during dog domestication is extremely challenging because the demographic fluctuations associated with domestication can produce signals in polymorphism data that mimic those imposed by selective sweeps. We perform the first analysis of selection on the dog lineage that explicitly incorporates a demographic model, that by controlling for the rate of false discovery, more robustly identifies targets of selection. To do so, we conduct a selection scan using three wolf genomes representing the putative centers of dog domestication, two basal dog breeds (Basenji and Dingo), and a golden jackal as outgroup, for which we previously inferred a demographic model. We find that our demographically informed analyses filters out many signals that would be otherwise classified as putative selection signals under an empirical outlier approach. We identify 68 regions of the genome that have likely experienced positive selection. Besides identifying a number of new neurobehavioral candidate genes, our candidate regions contain genes related to lipid metabolism, including CCRN4L, which is centered in the 3', ' ranked region. This suggests a previously unreported locus of dietary adaptation, potentially due to the change in diet composition as hunting efficiency increased when proto dogs began hunting alongside hunter-gatherers.']",['http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA274504'],3.0,52.0

However, accurate error-free measurement of microsatellite lengths is difficult with current methods precisely because of this high error rate during amplification. We have solved this problem by using partial mutagenesis to disrupt enough of the repeat structure of initial templates so that their sequence lengths replicate faithfully. In this work, we use bisulfite mutagenesis to convert a C to a U, later read as T. Compared to untreated templates, we achieve three orders of magnitude reduction in the error rate per round of replication.

Emergence of these activity patterns and functions is believed to be developmentally regulated, but the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown. We investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice. We reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. We hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks.', 'It can take several months, or even years, for the brain of a young animal to develop and refine the complex neural networks which underpin cognitive abilities such as memory, planning, and decision making. While the properties that support these functions have been well-documented, less is known about how they emerge during development.', 'Domínguez, Ma, Yu et al. therefore set out to determine when exactly these properties began to take shape in mice, using lightweight nets of electrodes to record brain activity in sleeping newborn pups. The nets were designed to avoid disturbing the animals or damaging their fragile brains.', 'The recordings showed that patterns of brain activity similar to those seen in adults emerged during the first couple of weeks after birth. Just before, however, the brains of the pups went through a brief period of reduced activity: this lull seemed to mark a transition from an immature to a more mature mode of operation. After this pause, neurons in the mouse brains showed coordinated patterns of firing reminiscent of those seen in adults. By monitoring the brains of human babies using scalp sensors, Domínguez, Ma, Yu et al. showed that a similar transition also occurs in infants during their first few months of life, suggesting that brains may mature via a process retained across species.', 'Overall, the relative lull in activity before transition may mark when neural networks gain mature properties; in the future, it could therefore potentially be used to diagnose and monitor individuals with delayed cognitive development.']",[],,2.0

Recent findings suggest that chromatin structure participates in its regulation. Here, we analyze the RNA from subcellular fractions obtained through RNA-seq in the cell line K562. We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. We introduce the coSI measure, based on RNA-seq reads mapping to exon junctions and borders, to assess the degree of splicing completion around internal exons. We show that, as expected, splicing is almost fully completed in cytosolic polyA+ RNA. In chromatin-associated RNA (which includes the RNA that is being transcribed), for 5.6% of exons, the removal of the surrounding introns is fully completed, compared with 0.3% of exons for which no intron-removal has occurred. The remaining exons exist as a mixture of spliced and fewer unspliced molecules, with a median coSI of 0.75. Thus, most RNAs undergo splicing while being transcribed: “co-transcriptional splicing.” Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs. CoSI scores decrease along the gene, pointing to a “first transcribed, first spliced” rule, yet more downstream exons carry other characteristics, favoring rapid, co-transcriptional intron removal. Exons with low coSI values, that is, in the process of being spliced, are enriched with chromatin marks, consistent with a role for chromatin in splicing during transcription. For alternative exons and long noncoding RNAs, splicing tends to occur later, and the latter might remain unspliced in some cases.']","['http://genome.crg.es/~htilgner/2011_coSI_paper/2011cp_index.html', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/', 'http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/downloads.html']",,321.0

However, as with any type of expression data, cross-dataset benchmarking of spatial data is a crucial first step. Here, we assess the replicability, with reference to canonical brain subdivisions, between the Allen Institute’s in situ hybridization data from the adult mouse brain (Allen Brain Atlas (ABA)) and a similar dataset collected using spatial transcriptomics (ST). With the advent of tractable spatial techniques, for the first time, we are able to benchmark the Allen Institute’s whole-brain, whole-transcriptome spatial expression dataset with a second independent dataset that similarly spans the whole brain and transcriptome. We use regularized linear regression (LASSO), linear regression, and correlation-based feature selection in a supervised learning framework to classify expression samples relative to their assayed location. We show that Allen Reference Atlas labels are classifiable using transcription in both data sets, but that performance is higher in the ABA than in ST. Furthermore, models trained in one dataset and tested in the opposite dataset do not reproduce classification performance bidirectionally. While an identifying expression profile can be found for a given brain area, it does not generalize to the opposite dataset. In general, we found that canonical brain area labels are classifiable in gene expression space within dataset and that our observed performance is not merely reflecting physical distance in the brain.

As input the user must upload a stack of images a codebook and a configuration file specifying parameters such as the radius of the smallest rolonies of interest (see S1 Appendix Section C as well as the NeuroCAAS link above for further details regarding the data format.) We assume that the images have been registered and background-subtracted before input into NeuroCAAS. There are three outputs from BarDensr NeuroCAAS implementation:The first output indicates candidate rolony locations. This output is represented in a comma-separated-value file listing all entries in the rolony density F which have signal greater than zero.The second output is designed to help the user assess the quality of the results; it is an HDF5 file which stores diagnostics about each detected rolony. See the next section for details.The third output is a plot designed to help the user assess the overall quality of the results. For each detected rolony we estimate the quality of evidence for that rolony by taking a key correlation coefficient (see the next section for details).

Using personal haploid genomes as the ground truth, we compared mapping errors for real RNA-seq reads aligned to the consensus genomes versus the reference genome.

Whether some genes are more likely to be differentially expressed than others, and to what degree, has never been assessed on a global scale. Here, we reanalyze more than 600 studies and find that knowledge of a gene’s prior probability of differential expression (DE) allows for accurate prediction of DE hit lists, regardless of the biological question. This result suggests redundancy in transcriptomics experiments that both informs gene set interpretation and highlights room for growth within the field.', 'Differential expression (DE) is commonly used to explore molecular mechanisms of biological conditions. While many studies report significant results between their groups of interest, the degree to which results are specific to the question at hand is not generally assessed, potentially leading to inaccurate interpretation. This could be particularly problematic for metaanalysis where replicability across datasets is taken as strong evidence for the existence of a specific, biologically relevant signal, but which instead may arise from recurrence of generic processes. To address this, we developed an approach to predict DE based on an analysis of over 600 studies. A predictor based on empirical prior probability of DE performs very well at this task (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, ∼0.8), indicating that a large fraction of DE hit lists are nonspecific. In contrast, predictors based on attributes such as gene function, mutation rates, or network features perform poorly. Genes associated with sex, the extracellular matrix, the immune system, and stress responses are prominent within the “DE prior.” In a series of control studies, we show that these patterns reflect shared biology rather than technical artifacts or ascertainment biases. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the DE prior to data interpretation in three use cases: (', ') breast cancer subtyping, (', ') single-cell genomics of pancreatic islet cells, and (', ') metaanalysis of lung adenocarcinoma and renal transplant rejection transcriptomics.

The R/Bioconductor package rnaseqcomp is available under open source license GPL-3. A key aspect of our proposed assessment is the availability of two datasets that permit the computation of the metrics. They are characterized by including two populations at least two replicates for each population and a way to define beforehand which genes or transcripts are differentially expressed and which are not. The replicates permit the assessment of precision and comparing the two populations permits the assessment of sensitivity or the ability to discover real biological differences. Note that sensitivity is harder to assess because we need to know beforehand what differences to expect. In the past this has been achieved with spike-in experiments [18–20]. However the use of spike-ins has been criticized for not properly mimicking real experimental data [21].The first represents the minimal dataset that can be used for the comparison. It includes two replicates for the cell lines GM12878 and K562. We used results from a microarray experiment comparing the same two cell lines to define real biological differences. We defined genes with a q-value smaller than 0.05 [22 23] and absolute log fold changes larger than 1 as truly differentially expressed. Genes with q-values larger than 0.5 were denoted as not differentially expressed. Genes in neither of these two groups were considered to be in a “grey area” and left out of the analysis. Note that we are not considering microarrays to be a gold standard but because the microarray data represents an independent measurement algorithms that perform better at detecting real differences should on average show improved agreement with these independent results.The second dataset was created using 30 samples from the Geuvadis project [24]. These samples were selected to represent a random sample of individuals. To introduce batch effect-like variability we selected 15 from one center and 15 from another. These were then randomly divided into two groups both having seven samples from one center and eight from another. Because the samples were assigned at random this is a null experiment and we can consider the 15 samples in each group to be replicates. To distinguish the two groups we used computer simulations to generate 2424 transcripts designed to be differentially expressed between the two groups. To make these abundances mimic experimental data we adapted the Polyester method [25] to include GC bias imitating the bias observed in the actual data. The resulting dataset mimics a real one quite well (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Estimated log fold changes stratified by transcript abundance on simulation dataset. One example based on Cufflinks quantification of two samples is shown here.

Advances in genomic technology need to be integrated with strategic genetic design and novel perspectives to break new ground. Complementary to individual-gene–targeted research, which remains challenging, a global assessment of the genomic distribution of trait-associated SNPs (TASs) discovered from genome scans of quantitative traits can provide insights into the genetic architecture and contribute to the design of future studies. Here we report the first systematic tabulation of the relative contribution of different genomic regions to quantitative trait variation in maize. We found that TASs were enriched in the nongenic regions, particularly within a 5-kb window upstream of genes, which highlights the importance of polymorphisms regulating gene expression in shaping the natural variation. Consistent with these findings, TASs collectively explained 44%–59% of the total phenotypic variation across maize quantitative traits, and on average, 79% of the explained variation could be attributed to TASs located in genes or within 5 kb upstream of genes, which together comprise only 13% of the genome.

Both small RNA species silence gene expression post-transcriptionally in association with the ARGONAUTE (AGO) family of proteins. In mammals, there are four AGO proteins (AGO1-4), of which only AGO2 possesses endonucleolytic activity. siRNAs trigger endonucleolytic cleavage of target mRNAs, mediated by AGO2, whereas miRNAs cause translational repression and mRNA decay through association with any of the four AGO proteins. ', ' deletion in mouse oocytes leads to female infertility due to defects during meiosis I. Because mouse oocytes express both miRNAs and endo-siRNAs, this phenotype could be due to the absence of either class of small RNA, or both. However, we and others demonstrated that miRNA function is suppressed in mouse oocytes, which suggested that endo-siRNAs, not miRNAs, are essential for female meiosis.

This study reveals that endo-siRNAs are essential during meiosis I in mouse females, demonstrating a role for endo-siRNAs in mammals.', 'In animals, the three main classes of small RNAs are microRNAs, short interfering RNAs, and PIWI-interacting RNAs. All three RNA species silence gene expression post-transcriptionally through interaction with the ARGONAUTE family of proteins. In mammals in particular, microRNAs are ubiquitously expressed, are essential for development, and perform numerous functions in a variety of cells and tissues. piRNAs are expressed almost exclusively in the germline, and are essential for male fertility and defense against transposons. Endogenous siRNAs are only expressed in germ cells and embryonic stem cells and have not been ascribed a functional role. By engineering a mouse that expresses a modified ARGONAUTE protein, we disrupt the function of endo-siRNAs exclusively in oocytes and find that females are infertile. Oocytes with an impaired siRNA pathway fail to complete meiosis I, and display severe spindle formation and chromosome alignment defects. Their transcriptome is widely perturbed and expression of the most abundant transposon is increased. These findings indicate that endo-siRNAs are essential for female fertility in mouse, are required for spindle formation, chromosome congression, and defense against transposons.

The subset of individuals selected should ensure that the captured genetic diversity is fully representative and includes variants across all subpopulations. For example, human variation has historically focused on individuals with European ancestry, but this represents a small fraction of the overall diversity. Addressing this, SVCollector identifies the optimal subset of individuals for resequencing by analyzing population-level VCF files from low-resolution genotyping studies. It then computes a ranked list of samples that maximizes the total number of variants present within a subset of a given size. To solve this optimization problem, SVCollector implements a fast, greedy heuristic and an exact algorithm using integer linear programming.

When selecting an optimal subset of 100 samples in these cohorts, SVCollector identifies individuals from every subpopulation, whereas naive methods yield an unbalanced selection. Finally, we show the number of variants present in cohorts selected using this approach follows a power-law distribution that is naturally related to the population genetic concept of the allele frequency spectrum, allowing us to estimate the diversity present with increasing numbers of samples.']",['http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.264879.120/-/DC1'],3.0,2.0

BACE1 is elevated ∼2–3 fold in AD brain and is concentrated in dystrophic neurites near plaques, suggesting BACE1 elevation is Aβ−dependent. Previously, we showed that phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α de-represses translation of BACE1 mRNA following stress such as energy deprivation. We hypothesized that stress induced by Aβ might increase BACE1 levels by the same translational mechanism involving eIF2α phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we used three different genetic strategies to determine the effects of reducing eIF2α phosphorylation on Aβ-dependent BACE1 elevation in vitro and in vivo: 1) a two-vector adeno-associated virus (AAV) system to express constitutively active GADD34, the regulatory subunit of PP1c eIF2α phosphatase; 2) a non-phosphorylatable eIF2α S51A knockin mutation; 3) a BACE1-YFP transgene lacking the BACE1 mRNA 5′ untranslated region (UTR) required for eIF2α translational regulation. The first two strategies were used in primary neurons and 5XFAD transgenic mice, while the third strategy was employed only in 5XFAD mice. Despite very effective reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation in both primary neurons and 5XFAD brains, or elimination of eIF2α-mediated regulation of BACE1-YFP mRNA translation in 5XFAD brains, Aβ-dependent BACE1 elevation was not decreased. Additionally, robust inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation did not block Aβ-dependent APP elevation in primary neurons, nor did it reduce amyloid pathology in 5XFAD mice. We conclude that amyloid-associated BACE1 elevation is not caused by translational de-repression via eIF2α phosphorylation, but instead appears to involve a post-translational mechanism. These definitive genetic results exclude a role for eIF2α phosphorylation in Aβ-dependent BACE1 and APP elevation. We suggest a vicious pathogenic cycle wherein Aβ42 toxicity induces peri-plaque BACE1 and APP accumulation in dystrophic neurites leading to exacerbated Aβ production and plaque progression.']",[],2.0,31.0

One prediction of this “primacy coding” scheme is that decisions based on odor identity can be made solely using early odor-evoked neural activity. Using an optogenetic masking paradigm, we define the sensory integration time necessary for odor identification and demonstrate that animals can use information occurring <100\u2009ms after inhalation onset to identify odors. Using multi-electrode array recordings of odor responses in the olfactory bulb, we find that concentration-invariant units respond earliest and at latencies that are within this behaviorally-defined time window.

Here, we investigate blood-based DNA methylation in a large family where a balanced translocation between chromosomes 1 and 11 shows genome-wide significant linkage to psychiatric illness. Genome-wide DNA methylation was profiled in whole-blood-derived DNA from 41 individuals using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). We found significant differences in DNA methylation when translocation carriers (', '\u2009=\u200917) were compared to related non-carriers (', '\u2009=\u200924) at 13 loci. All but one of the 13 significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) mapped to the regions surrounding the translocation breakpoints. Methylation levels of five DMPs were associated with genotype at SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with the translocation. Two of the five genes harbouring significant DMPs, ', ' and ', ', have been previously shown to be differentially methylated in schizophrenia. Gene Ontology analysis revealed enrichment for terms relating to neuronal function and neurodevelopment among the genes harbouring the most significant DMPs.

In many cases, such as vegetation or bacterial biofilms, dense surface-bound populations compete for both resources and physical space. How do these territorial interactions impact ecosystem behavior and biodiversity? We study a theoretical model of territorial resource competition with trade-offs and show that many features of real ecosystems emerge naturally, including slow population dynamics that render community composition susceptible to demographic and other noise. We also observe alternate steady states, including the Allee effect in which survival requires a minimum population. Importantly, we demonstrate that biodiversity occurs robustly and can arise in territorial communities simply due to competition for resources.', 'Many ecosystems, from vegetation to biofilms, are composed of territorial populations that compete for both nutrients and physical space. What are the implications of such spatial organization for biodiversity? To address this question, we developed and analyzed a model of territorial resource competition. In the model, all species obey trade-offs inspired by biophysical constraints on metabolism; the species occupy nonoverlapping territories, while nutrients diffuse in space. We find that the nutrient diffusion time is an important control parameter for both biodiversity and the timescale of population dynamics. Interestingly, fast nutrient diffusion allows the populations of some species to fluctuate to zero, leading to extinctions. Moreover, territorial competition spontaneously gives rise to both multistability and the Allee effect (in which a minimum population is required for survival), so that small perturbations can have major ecological effects. While the assumption of trade-offs allows for the coexistence of more species than the number of nutrients—thus violating the principle of competitive exclusion—overall biodiversity is curbed by the domination of “oligotroph” species. Importantly, in contrast to well-mixed models, spatial structure renders diversity robust to inequalities in metabolic trade-offs. Our results suggest that territorial ecosystems can display high biodiversity and rich dynamics simply due to competition for resources in a spatial community.']",['https://github.com/BenjaminWeiner/ecology-territorial-populations'],3.0,10.0

Crucially, they also need to compete for the interpretation of those signals with other neurons representing similar features. The form that this competition should take depends critically on the noise corrupting these signals. In this study we show that for the type of noise commonly observed in sensory systems, whose variance scales with the mean signal, sensory neurons should selectively divide their input signals by their predictions, suppressing ambiguous cues while amplifying others. Any change in the stimulus context alters which inputs are suppressed, leading to a deep dynamic reshaping of neural receptive fields going far beyond simple surround suppression. Paradoxically, these highly variable receptive fields go alongside and are in fact required for an invariant representation of external sensory features. In addition to offering a normative account of context-dependent changes in sensory responses, perceptual inference in the presence of signal-dependent noise accounts for ubiquitous features of sensory neurons such as divisive normalization, gain control and contrast dependent temporal dynamics.', 'Perception involves using incoming sensory signals to infer which objects or features are present in the surroundings. To do this, sensory systems must perform two basic operations: (i) combination of noisy sensory cues, and (ii) competition between different percepts. Here we show that the optimal form of competition depends on how sensory signals are corrupted by noise. Moreover, for the type of noise commonly observed in sensory systems, whose variance scales with the signal amplitude, competition should occur between different sensory cues ', ' they are combined. Implemented neurally, this results in a highly flexible representation, in which neural receptive fields change dynamically depending on the stimulus context. Further we show that competition should take the form of divisive inhibition from the surround, accounting for why divisive normalisation, gain control and contrast dependent temporal dynamics appear so ubiquitous in sensory areas.']",['https://sourceforge.net/projects/divnorm/'],3.0,8.0

Later, the double hexamer recruits Cdc45 and GINS to form two active and separate DNA helicases. The active Cdc45–Mcm2-7–GINS helicase encircles the leading strand while excluding the lagging strand. One of the fundamental unanswered questions is how each Mcm2-7 hexamer converts from binding dsDNA to binding one of the single strands. The structure of the double hexamer on dsDNA reveals how DNA interacts with key elements inside the central channel, leading us to propose a lagging-strand extrusion mechanism. This work advances our understanding of eukaryotic replication initiation.', 'During replication initiation, the core component of the helicase—the Mcm2-7 hexamer—is loaded on origin DNA as a double hexamer (DH). The two ring-shaped hexamers are staggered, leading to a kinked axial channel. How the origin DNA interacts with the axial channel is not understood, but the interaction could provide key insights into Mcm2-7 function and regulation. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the Mcm2-7 DH on dsDNA and show that the DNA is zigzagged inside the central channel. Several of the Mcm subunit DNA-binding loops, such as the oligosaccharide–oligonucleotide loops, helix 2 insertion loops, and presensor 1 (PS1) loops, are well defined, and many of them interact extensively with the DNA. The PS1 loops of Mcm 3, 4, 6, and 7, but not 2 and 5, engage the lagging strand with an approximate step size of one base per subunit. Staggered coupling of the two opposing hexamers positions the DNA right in front of the two Mcm2–Mcm5 gates, with each strand being pressed against one gate. The architecture suggests that lagging-strand extrusion initiates in the middle of the DH that is composed of the zinc finger domains of both hexamers. To convert the Mcm2-7 DH structure into the Mcm2-7 hexamer structure found in the active helicase, the N-tier ring of the Mcm2-7 hexamer in the DH-dsDNA needs to tilt and shift laterally. We suggest that these N-tier ring movements cause the DNA strand separation and lagging-strand extrusion.']","['http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/EMD-9400', '5BK4']",,57.0

To illustrate our method we reanalyze population data from four datasets comprising different species, different cortical areas and different experimental tasks.

Analysing such large amounts of data then becomes a challenge in itself.', 'This is particularly true for brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex that are involved in the cognitive processes that allow an animal to acquire knowledge. Individual neurons in the prefrontal cortex encode many different types of information relevant to a given task. Imagine, for example, that an animal has to select one of two objects to obtain a reward. The same group of prefrontal cortex neurons will encode the object presented to the animal, the animal’s decision and its confidence in that decision. This simultaneous representation of different elements of a task is called a ‘mixed’ representation, and is difficult to analyse.', 'Kobak, Brendel et al. have now developed a data analysis tool that can ‘demix’ neural activity. The tool breaks down the activity of a population of neurons into its individual components. Each of these relates to only a single aspect of the task and is thus easier to interpret.

Using this tool, we validated the majority of SNPs called against matching short-read data from embryo, endosperm and root tissues, and identified allele-specific, gene-level and isoform-level differential expression between the inbred parental lines and hybrid offspring. After phasing 6907 genes in the reciprocal hybrids, we annotated the SNPs and identified large-effect genes. In addition, we identified parent-of-origin isoforms, distinct novel isoforms in maize parent and hybrid lines, and imprinted genes from different tissues. Finally, we characterized variation in cis- and trans-regulatory effects. Our study provides measures of haplotypic expression that could increase accuracy in studies of allelic expression.', 'Bo Wang et al. report an isoform-level phasing study in maize using long-read cDNA sequencing and a new method, IsoPhase, to annotate allele-specific, gene-level and isoform-level expression.

Twenty-one subjects underwent non-invasive pulmonary diagnostic testing, including maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) and impulse oscillometry (IOS). In addition, five soldiers received a lung biopsy; tissue results were compared to a previously published sample from a soldier in our Iraq Afghanistan War Lung Injury database and others in our database with similar exposures, including burn pits.

Lung tissue, when available, was examined for carbonaceous particles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Raman spectroscopy), metals, titanium connected to iron (Brookhaven National Laboratory, National Synchrotron Light Source II, Beamline 5-ID), oxidized metals, combustion temperature, inflammatory cell accumulation and fibrosis, neutrophil extracellular traps, Sirius red, Prussian Blue, as well as polarizable crystals/particulate matter/dust.

Combustion temperature was consistent with that of burned petrol rather than higher temperatures noted with cigarettes. All were nonsmokers. Neutrophil extracellular traps were reported in two biopsies. Compared to our prior biopsies in our Middle East deployment database, these histopathologic results are similar, since all database biopsies have constrictive bronchiolitis, one has lung fibrosis with titanium bound to iron in fixed mathematical ratios of 1:7 and demonstrated polarizable crystals.

As recombination increases genetic diversity, hotspots are predicted to occur at immunity genes, where variation may be beneficial. A major component of plant immunity is recognition of pathogen Avirulence (Avr) effectors by resistance (', ') genes that encode NBS-LRR domain proteins. Therefore, we sought to test whether NBS-LRR genes would overlap with meiotic crossover hotspots using experimental genetics in ', '. NBS-LRR genes tend to physically cluster in plant genomes; for example, in Arabidopsis most are located in large clusters on the south arms of chromosomes 1 and 5. We experimentally mapped 1,439 crossovers within these clusters and observed NBS-LRR gene associated hotspots, which were also detected as historical hotspots via analysis of linkage disequilibrium. However, we also observed NBS-LRR gene coldspots, which in some cases correlate with structural heterozygosity. To study recombination at the fine-scale we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze ~1,000 crossovers within the ', ' (', ') ', ' gene hotspot. This revealed elevated intragenic crossovers, overlapping nucleosome-occupied exons that encode the TIR, NBS and LRR domains. The highest ', ' recombination frequency was promoter-proximal and overlapped CTT-repeat DNA sequence motifs, which have previously been associated with plant crossover hotspots. Additionally, we show a significant influence of natural genetic variation on NBS-LRR cluster recombination rates, using crosses between Arabidopsis ecotypes. In conclusion, we show that a subset of NBS-LRR genes are strong hotspots, whereas others are coldspots. This reveals a complex recombination landscape in Arabidopsis NBS-LRR genes, which we propose results from varying coevolutionary pressures exerted by host-pathogen relationships, and is influenced by structural heterozygosity.', 'The majority of plants, animals and fungi reproduce sexually, which has a profound effect on patterns of genetic diversity. For sexual reproduction to occur a specialized cell division called meiosis generates gametes (sex cells) with recombined DNA. During meiosis homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal exchange of genetic material called crossover, which mixes parental sequences. Crossover frequency is highly variable along chromosomes and is typically concentrated in narrow regions called hotspots. Sexual reproduction is proposed to provide a major advantage during host-pathogen coevolution. This theory predicts that crossover hotspots will be associated with genes that play important roles in the immune system, where diversity may be beneficial. To investigate this idea we mapped patterns of crossover frequency in relation to genes that plants use to recognize pathogens. We observe that a subset of ', ' resistance genes overlap with strong crossover hotspots. However, we also observe resistance gene coldspots, which correlate with chromosomal rearrangements between varietal lines (ecotypes). Using Arabidopsis ecotypes we also show that natural genetic variation has a strong modifying effect on resistance gene cluster recombination rates. Together our work shows complex variation in resistance gene crossover patterns, which may relate to heterogeneity in coevolutionary pressures experienced at different loci, in addition to the effects of structural genetic diversity.']",[],2.0,53.0

Here we describe a new experimental approach, called Tite-Seq, that is capable of measuring binding titration curves and corresponding affinities for thousands of variant antibodies in parallel. The measurement of titration curves eliminates the confounding effects of antibody expression and stability that arise in standard deep mutational scanning assays. We demonstrate Tite-Seq on the CDR1H and CDR3H regions of a well-studied scFv antibody. Our data shed light on the structural basis for antigen binding affinity and suggests a role for secondary CDR loops in establishing antibody stability. Tite-Seq fills a large gap in the ability to measure critical aspects of the adaptive immune system, and can be readily used for studying sequence-affinity landscapes in other protein systems.', '\n', 'Antibodies are proteins produced by cells of the immune system to tag or neutralize potential threats to the body, such as foreign substances and disease-causing microbes. Antibodies do this by binding to target molecules called antigens. An antibody’s ability to bind to an antigen depends on the sequence of amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – that make up the antibody. Through a process that randomizes this sequence of amino acids, the immune system generates a vast pool of antibodies that are able to target almost any foreign antigen that exists in nature.', 'Currently, little is understood about how the sequence of amino acids in an antibody determines how strongly that antibody binds to its antigen target – a property referred to as the antibody’s binding affinity. Answering this fundamental question requires techniques that can measure the affinities of many different antibodies at the same time. However, previous high-throughput methods have been unable to provide quantitative measurements of binding affinities. These kinds of measurements are difficult because an antibody’s amino acid sequence governs more than just binding affinity: it also affects how easy it is to produce that antibody, and what fraction of antibody molecules work properly.', 'Adams et al. now describe a new method, named “Tite-Seq”, that overcomes these issues. First, thousands of different antibodies are displayed on the surface of yeast cells, with each cell carrying a single kind of antibody. These cells are then incubated with fluorescently labeled antigen at a wide range of different concentrations. Next, the yeast cells are sorted based on how brightly they glow; brighter cells have more antigen bound to them, and so it is possible to calculate how much of the antigen is bound to each kind of antibody at each concentration.

A quantitative ChIP-seq approach, which allows detection of global occupancy change, was employed to measure H2A.Z occupancy.

Before DNA replication can begin, a number of proteins must come together to form so-called pre-replicative complexes at many locations along the DNA molecules. These protein complexes then serve as landing pads for many other DNA replication proteins.', 'One component of the pre-replicative complex, a protein called ORC1, helps to recruit another protein called CDC6 that in turn acts with Cyclin E to promote the replication of the DNA. Cyclin E is a protein that is only expressed when cells commit to divide. Previous research has shown that a lack of ORC1 causes the levels of Cyclin E to rise in human cells, but it was not understood how cells regulate the levels of Cyclin E.', 'Now, Hossain and Stillman show that the ORC1 protein switches off the gene that encodes Cyclin E early on in newly born cells, and therefore prevents the Cyclin E protein from being produced. The experiments show that ORC1 does this by binding near one end of the gene for Cyclin E and interacting with two other proteins to inactivate the gene. Thus, ORC1 establishes a period when Cyclin E is absent from a newly formed cell. This essentially gives the cell time to ‘decide’ (based on external cues and its own signaling) whether it will divide again or enter into a non-dividing state.', 'When a cell does decide to divide, the levels of CDC6 rise. CDC6 is another component of the pre-replicative complex and Hossain and Stillman find that CDC6 works to counteract the effects of ORC1 and reactivate the gene for Cyclin E.

The gene set analysis software was compared using three datasets including two large studies and one small one.The two large studies included a lung cancer set was provided with GSEA-R package [49] and a type 2 diabetes dataset comes from ChipperDB [51]. These datasets were chosen because they were originally used to validate and/or compare GSEA [34] and PAGE [5]The small dataset is a gene expression study from our group describing human MSC response to 8 hours of exposure to the signaling molecule BMP6. This dataset includes two experimental groups each with paired treatment and control samples resulting in a total of 4 gene chips. We have deposited the dataset into Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (accession number GSE13604).

We assayed the levels of transcriptionally-engaged polymerase using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) in control and GAF-RNAi Drosophila S2 cells and found promoter-proximal polymerase was significantly reduced on a large subset of paused promoters where GAF occupancy was reduced by knock down. These promoters show a dramatic increase in nucleosome occupancy upon GAF depletion. These results, in conjunction with previous studies showing that GAF directly interacts with nucleosome remodelers, strongly support a model where GAF directs nucleosome displacement at the promoter and thereby allows the entry Pol II to the promoter and pause sites. This action of GAF on nucleosomes is at least partially independent of paused Pol II because intergenic GAF binding sites with little or no Pol II also show GAF-dependent nucleosome displacement. In addition, the insulator factor BEAF, the BEAF-interacting protein Chriz, and the transcription factor M1BP are strikingly enriched on those GAF-associated genes where pausing is unaffected by knock down, suggesting insulators or the alternative promoter-associated factor M1BP protect a subset of GAF-bound paused genes from GAF knock-down effects. Thus, GAF binding at promoters can lead to the local displacement of nucleosomes, but this activity can be restricted or compensated for when insulator protein or M1BP complexes also reside at GAF bound promoters.', 'Transcriptional regulation is critical for proper gene expression in response to environmental changes and developmental programs. Eukaryotes have evolved multiple mechanisms by which transcription factors regulate transcription. One mechanism is the reorganization of chromatin to allow Pol II recruitment. Another is the release of promoter-proximal paused Pol II, where Pol II transcription that is halted 20–60 bases downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) is allowed to enter into productive elongation through the gene body. The Drosophila transcription factor GAF binds to genes that undergo pausing and interacts with nucleosome remodelers and the pausing factor NELF. Thus, GAF can regulate multiple points necessary for transcription, but its mechanistic role is not fully understood genome-wide. We depleted GAF from cells and examined the genome-wide changes in Pol II and nucleosome distributions across genes. We found that GAF depletion reduces polymerase density at genes where GAF binds just upstream of the TSS, and results in nucleosomes moving into the promoter region. Our results show that GAF is important for maintaining the promoter accessibility, allowing Pol II to be recruited to promoters and enter the pause sites downstream of the TSS. Thus, GAF is critical for providing the chromatin environment necessary for the proper control of gene expression.']",[],3.0,60.0

Here we show that the effects of reward on perceptual decisions are principled: past rewards bias future choices specifically when previous choice was difficult and hence decision confidence was low. We identified this phenomenon in six datasets from four laboratories, across mice, rats, and humans, and sensory modalities from olfaction and audition to vision. We show that this choice-updating strategy can be explained by reinforcement learning models incorporating statistical decision confidence into their teaching signals.

The products of the RACE reaction are hybridized onto tiling arrays, and the exons detected are used to delineate a series of RT-PCR reactions, through which the original RACE mixture is segregated into simpler RT-PCR reactions. These are independently cloned, and randomly selected clones are sequenced. This approach is superior to direct cloning and sequencing of RACE products: it specifically targets novel transcripts, and often results in overall normalization of transcript abundances.

Pre-treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug, 80 μM dimethyl fumarate (DMFu), blocked TNFα-induced inflammatory activation of RPE (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, CFH, CFB, C3) and normalized their bioenergetic profile to control levels by regulating PFKFB3 and PKM2 gene expression. Furthermore, DMFu prevented TNFα-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and morphological anomalies. Thus, our results indicate that DMFu serves as a novel therapeutic avenue for combating inflammatory activation and metabolic dysfunction of RPE in AMD.']",[],2.0,5.0

To investigate DNA replication programs in these two types of cell cycles, we pulse labeled intact root tips of maize (', ') with 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) and used flow sorting of nuclei to examine DNA replication timing (RT) during the transition from a mitotic cycle to an endocycle. Comparison of the sequence-based RT profiles showed that most regions of the maize genome replicate at the same time during S phase in mitotic and endocycling cells, despite the need to replicate twice as much DNA in the endocycle and the fact that endocycling is typically associated with cell differentiation. However, regions collectively corresponding to 2% of the genome displayed significant changes in timing between the two types of cell cycles. The majority of these regions are small with a median size of 135 kb, shift to a later RT in the endocycle, and are enriched for genes expressed in the root tip. We found larger regions that shifted RT in centromeres of seven of the ten maize chromosomes. These regions covered the majority of the previously defined functional centromere, which ranged between 1 and 2 Mb in size in the reference genome. They replicate mainly during mid S phase in mitotic cells but primarily in late S phase of the endocycle. In contrast, the immediately adjacent pericentromere sequences are primarily late replicating in both cell cycles. Analysis of CENH3 enrichment levels in 8C vs 2C nuclei suggested that there is only a partial replacement of CENH3 nucleosomes after endocycle replication is complete. The shift to later replication of centromeres and possible reduction in CENH3 enrichment after endocycle replication is consistent with a hypothesis that centromeres are inactivated when their function is no longer needed.', 'In traditional cell division, or mitosis, a cell’s genetic material is duplicated and then split between two daughter cells. In contrast, in some specialized cell types, the DNA is duplicated a second time without an intervening division step, resulting in cells that carry twice as much DNA. This phenomenon, which is called the endocycle, is common during plant development. At each step, DNA replication follows an ordered program in which highly compacted DNA is unraveled and replicated in sections at different times during the synthesis (S) phase. In plants, it is unclear whether traditional and endocycle programs are the same, especially since endocycling cells are typically in the process of differentiation. Using root tips of maize, we found that in comparison to replication in the mitotic cell cycle, there is a small portion of the genome whose replication in the endocycle is shifted in time, usually to later in S phase. Some of these regions are scattered around the genome and mostly coincide with active genes. However, the most prominent shifts occur in centromeres. The shift to later replication in centromeres is noteworthy because they orchestrate the process of separating duplicated chromosomes into daughter cells, a function that is not needed in the endocycle.']",[],5.0,2.0

Celastrol is known to elicit a cellular stress response resembling the response to heat shock, but the transcriptional basis of this response remains unclear. Our analysis of PRO-seq data for K562 cells reveals dramatic transcriptional effects soon after celastrol treatment at a broad collection of both coding and noncoding transcription units. This transcriptional response occurred in two major waves, one within 10 min, and a second 40–60 min after treatment. Transcriptional activity was generally repressed by celastrol, but one distinct group of genes, enriched for roles in the heat shock response, displayed strong activation. Using a regression approach, we identified key transcription factors that appear to drive these transcriptional responses, including members of the E2F and RFX families. We also found sequence-based evidence that particular transcription factors drive the activation of enhancers. We observed increased polymerase pausing at both genes and enhancers, suggesting that pause release may be widely inhibited during the celastrol response.

Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.']",[],3.0,247.0

This enhancer switching results in the re-distribution of transcriptional co-activators, including Brd4, and provides the opportunity to disable their activity and overcome epigenetic resistance. Together these findings highlight key principles to help counteract non-genetic drug resistance.', 'There is increasing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to therapeutic resistance in cancer.

We compared whole-genome, single-CpG DNA methylation profiles in sperm of seven species—human, chimpanzee, gorilla, rhesus macaque, mouse, rat, and dog—to investigate epigenomic evolution. We developed a phylo-epigenetic model for DNA methylation that accommodates the correlation of states at neighboring sites and allows for inference of ancestral states. Applying this model to the sperm methylomes, we uncovered an overall evolutionary expansion of the hypomethylated fraction of the genome, driven both by the birth of new hypomethylated regions and by extensive widening of hypomethylated intervals in ancestral species. This expansion shows strong lineage-specific aspects, most notably that hypomethylated intervals around transcription start sites have evolved to be considerably wider in primates and dog than in rodents, whereas rodents show evidence of a greater trend toward birth of new hypomethylated regions. Lineage-specific hypomethylated regions are enriched near sets of genes with common developmental functions and significant overlap across lineages. Rodent-specific and primate-specific hypomethylated regions are enriched for binding sites of similar transcription factors, suggesting that the plasticity accommodated by certain regulatory factors is conserved, despite substantial change in the specific sites of regulation.

By contrast, discrete-event feedback (e.g. a server acknowledging when data are successfully transmitted, or a brief antennal interaction when an ant returns to the nest after successful foraging) can reduce costs associated with monitoring a continuous variable; however, optimizing behaviour in this setting requires alternative strategies. Here, we studied parallels between discrete-event feedback control strategies in biological and engineered systems. We found that two common engineering rules—additive-increase, upon positive feedback, and multiplicative-decrease, upon negative feedback, and multiplicative-increase multiplicative-decrease—are used by diverse biological systems, including for regulating foraging by harvester ant colonies, for maintaining cell-size homeostasis, and for synaptic learning and adaptation in neural circuits. These rules support several goals of these systems, including optimizing efficiency (i.e. using all available resources); splitting resources fairly among cooperating agents, or conversely, acquiring resources quickly among competing agents; and minimizing the latency of responses, especially when conditions change. We hypothesize that theoretical frameworks from distributed computing may offer new ways to analyse adaptation behaviour of biology systems, and in return, biological strategies may inspire new algorithms for discrete-event feedback control in engineering.']",[],0.0,2.0

Using a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) model, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation by TIGAR supports premalignant tumor initiation while restricting metastasis. Increased ROS in PDAC cells drives a phenotypic switch that increases migration, invasion, and metastatic capacity. This switch is dependent on increased activation of MAPK signaling and can be reverted by antioxidant treatment. In mouse and human, TIGAR expression is modulated during PDAC development, with higher TIGAR levels in premalignant lesions and lower TIGAR levels in metastasizing tumors. Our study indicates that temporal, dynamic control of ROS underpins full malignant progression and helps to rationalize conflicting reports of pro- and anti-tumor effects of antioxidant treatment.', 'Cheung et\xa0al. show that TIGAR expression is dynamically regulated during the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, resulting in lower levels of ROS to promote tumor initiation in the premalignant condition and higher levels of ROS that enable metastatic progression.']",[],0.0,114.0
To illustrate our analyses we used data from publically accessible RNA-seq experiments where we define an experiment as a set of samples. The majority of the work and analyses were performed using the following datasets: ENCODE (GSE35584) [34] Marioni et al (GSE11045) [21] Xu et al (GSE26109) [22] and BrainSpan [35]. The ENCODE dataset and the Marioni et al. dataset were downloaded from SRA and converted to fastq files using “fastq-dump” from the SRA Toolkit [36]. Following quality control using the fastX tools we mapped the reads using bowtie2 [37] and estimated the RPKM and FPKM expression levels using RSEQtools [38] and Cufflinks [39] respectively and the GENCODE annotations file [17] (version 18). We used the processed data provided in the Xu et al. supplement and the online Brainspan data. For our assessment of publically available data we looked at those accessible both via Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA). We used the URL from the GEO browser [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/browse/?view=samples&amp;display=500&amp;type=10&amp;tax=9606&amp;sort=type] filtering on human samples and those in SRA as of January 2015. Of the resulting 39K samples we then filtered on samples only in a single experiments (unique to one GSE ID close to 1.4K experiments) and then calculated the sample size for each of these. For a final follow up we then obtained 83 RNA-seq experiments from the Gemma database [40] that were processed using RSEM [41]. These experiments varied in experimental design sample size read depth sample type and conditions. All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files. All scripts are available at https://github.com/sarbal/AuPairWise.,1057,AuPairWise: A Method to Estimate RNA-Seq Replicability through Co-expressionRNA-Seq Replicability via Co-expression,['2016'],"['Sara Ballouz', 'Jesse Gillis']",['PLoS Computational Biology'],[],27082953,['4833304'],10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004868,"['In addition to detecting novel transcripts and higher dynamic range, a principal claim for RNA-sequencing has been greater replicability, typically measured in sample-sample correlations of gene expression levels. Through a re-analysis of ENCODE data, we show that replicability of transcript abundances will provide misleading estimates of the replicability of conditional variation in transcript abundances (i.e., most expression experiments). Heuristics which implicitly address this problem have emerged in quality control measures to obtain ‘good’ differential expression results. However, these methods involve strict filters such as discarding low expressing genes or using technical replicates to remove discordant transcripts, and are costly or simply ad hoc. As an alternative, we model gene-level replicability of differential activity using co-expressing genes. We find that sets of housekeeping interactions provide a sensitive means of estimating the replicability of expression changes, where the co-expressing pair can be regarded as pseudo-replicates of one another. We model the effects of noise that perturbs a gene’s expression within its usual distribution of values and show that perturbing expression by only 5% within that range is readily detectable (AUROC~0.73). We have made our method available as a set of easily implemented R scripts.', 'RNA-sequencing has become a popular means to detect the expression levels of genes. However, quality control is still challenging, requiring both extreme measures and rules which are set in stone from extensive previous analysis. Instead of relying on these rules, we show that co-expression can be used to measure biological replicability with extremely high precision. Co-expression is a well-studied phenomenon in which two genes that are known to form a functional unit are also expressed at similar levels, and change in similar ways across conditions. Using this concept, we can detect how well an experiment replicates by measuring how well it has retained the co-expression pattern across defined gene-pairs. We do this by measuring how easy it is to detect a sample to which some noise has been added. We show this method is a useful tool for quality control.']","['https://github.com/sarbal/AuPairWise', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/browse/?view=samples&display=500&type=10&tax=9606&sort=type']",,6.0

Here, we used large-scale electron tomography to study the morphology of the MT minus ends in three dimensionally reconstructed metaphase spindles in HeLa cells.

Altogether, these data suggest a correlation between the morphology and the dynamic state of the MT ends.

We assign promoter sequences as non-CpG related if the normalized CpG content of the 3 kb centered at the TSS is less than 0.3 and as CpG related otherwise. (Normalized CpG content was computed as in [13]: fCG/eCG where fCG is observed CG frequency eCG is the expected frequency calculated as [(fC + fG)/2]2 and fC and fG are the frequencies of C and G respectively.) This working definition is based on the observation that the CpG content follows a bimodal distribution which naturally separates the promoters into two classes [1113]. Saxonov and coworkers [13] used 0.35 as a threshold to define CpG-related or non-CpG-related promoters. Better classification results are produced when we are more strict in defining non-CpG-related promoters. (Additional data file 1 gives detailed comparisons between the program using 0.35 as the threshold and the program using 0.3 as the threshold.)To build any promoter model one needs a collection of promoter sequences with high-quality annotation. We used the annotations from the EPD (version 79) [33] and the DBTSS (version 3.0) [2]. (EPD is based on experimentally determined TSSs and DBTSS on full-length oligo-capped cDNA sequences.) EPD generally has better quality annotation than DBTSS but because there are only 299 non-CpG-related promoters from EPD we also included 1271 DBTSS-annotated promoters for training. After removing redundancy we had 1445 CpG-related promoters from EPD and 1570 non-CpG-related promoters combining both EPD and DBTSS promoters. The promoter sequences 250 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream of the TSS were extracted as the positive training set. The four (two upstream and two downstream) nonoverlapping consecutive segments immediately upstream and downstream of the positive set were used as our negative training set.In the fivefold cross-validation study for non-CpG-related promoters the set of 299 non-CpG-related promoters from EPD and four-fifths of 1271 promoters from DBTSS was used to train a model and the remaining set of one-fifth of the sequences of 2.4 kb each centered at the DBTSS-annotated TSS was used as test data.For comparison we also applied different programs to the sequences extracted from the genome-wide mapping data of promoters obtained from the ChIP-chip technology [4]. Testing the trained model on a separate dataset is important to achieve an unbiased evaluation. Therefore we kept those sequences 2.4 kb centered at the probes where there was only one DBTSS annotation and no more than one probe in the same sequence. This left us with 85 non-CpG-related and 1765 CpG-related test sequences of 2.4 kb each.From CSHL Mammalian Promoter Database (CSHLmpd) [34] we defined the tissue-specific activity of each human promoter based on the tissue information of mRNAs and expressed sequence tags overlapping promoters at the 5' end. We found most housekeeping gene promoters to be CpG related as expected whereas promoters active in only a few tissues are more likely to be non-CpG related consistent with previous reports [2635]. Among 636 so-called tissue-specific non-CpG-related promoters 84 are muscle specific. We applied leave-one-out cross-validation to this set of 84 promoters. The following additional data are available with the online version of this article.

These receptors form heteromeric ion channels and become activated upon concurrent binding of glycine and glutamate to the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, respectively.
