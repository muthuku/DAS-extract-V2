At one extreme, the neural representation could be dense, engaging a large fraction of neurons, each with a broad receptive field. At the other extreme, the neural representation could be sparse, at any moment of time engaging only a small fraction of neurons, each highly selective with a narrow receptive field. Although a dense code under some conditions makes the most efficient use of the &#x0201c;representational bandwidth&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] available in a neuronal population&#x02014;why should a large fraction of neurons remain silent most of the time?&#x02014;sparse models have recently gained support on both theoretical [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and experimental [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] grounds. However, it is not at present clear which of these is a better model of sensory representations in the auditory cortex. In order to distinguish between these alternatives experimentally, we must know what fraction of neurons responds to a given stimulus.</p><p>The direct experimental approach to measuring the density of a cortical code would begin by simultaneously recording sound-evoked responses of all the neurons in the auditory cortex to an ensemble of stimuli; one could then simply count the number of spikes elicited by each stimulus. Unfortunately, currently available recording techniques do not permit such a direct approach. An alternative approach is to record the activity of a representative subset of neurons serially, and infer the population response from this sample. In this way, the population code could in principle be inferred by sequentially sampling a large population of single unit responses.</p><p>We have used cell-attached recording in the primary auditory cortex of unanesthetized rats to sample the population response to brief tones and other stimuli. Because we were interested in the population response, we presented a restricted ensemble of stimuli to each neuron, rather than optimizing the stimulus to drive each neuron to fire maximally [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus we could assess the fraction of neurons that responded for each stimulus we presented. The stimuli ranged from simple (tones, sweeps, white-noise bursts) to complex (natural sounds). Our data therefore address the question: What is the typical response across the entire neuronal population to a particular stimulus? Rather than: What is the optimal stimulus for a particular neuron? (see also [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]).</p><p>We find that the typical population response in unanesthetized auditory cortex is sparse. Consistent with previous findings in barrel cortex [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], some neurons had very low spontaneous firing rates (&#x0003c;0.01 spikes/second); at the other extreme, some neurons had driven rates in excess of 50 spikes/second. However, a given stimulus typically elicited a high firing rate (&#x0003e;20 spikes/second) in less than 5% of the population. Note that sparseness as used here refers only to the fraction of neurons active at a given instant; it is quite possible that each neuron might, under the appropriate conditions (e.g., when presented with an optimal stimulus), participate in a representation by firing at a high rate. Our results represent, to our knowledge, the first quantitative experimental support for the hypothesis that the representation of sounds in the auditory cortex of unanesthetized animals is sparse.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded responses of neurons in the auditory cortex of head-fixed unanesthetized rats. Because our approach was to construct the population response one neuron at a time, we did not optimize the stimulus ensemble to conform to the response properties of each neuron, but instead probed many neurons with the same ensemble. In this way, we could reconstruct the overall population response.</p><p>We probed neurons with four different ensembles: tones (at three different intensities), sweeps, white-noise bursts, and natural sounds. These ensembles were selected because they span the range from spectrotemporally simple to complex.</p><p>Our goal was to record the responses to stimuli generated by a representative sampling of neurons in the auditory cortex. We therefore chose to record with a glass patch pipette in cell-attached mode, a method which is not explicitly biased toward active and responsive neurons, or neurons with large action potentials, and which provides excellent single unit isolation [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g001">Figure 1</xref>). With cell-attached recording, single unit isolation depends on the physical contact between the glass electrode tip and the neuron. The selection bias of cell-attached recording is thus based on the neuron's &#x0201c;patchability,&#x0201d; rather than on the firing rate or responsiveness of the target neuron; only to the extent that patchability is correlated with functional characteristics such as firing rate or responsiveness would cell-attached recording (indirectly) bias the sampled population. In contrast, good single unit isolation with conventional extracellular (e.g., tungsten; [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) electrodes requires a sufficient number of spikes; skilled practitioners typically search for neurons with sufficiently high firing rates and large spikes. Although it would be possible for a committed investigator to isolate neurons with a low spontaneous firing rate, for the purposes of this study cell-attached recording seemed a particularly suitable choice.</p><fig id="pbio-0060016-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Cell-Attached Recordings in the Unanesthetized Auditory Cortex</title><p>(A) Cell-attached recording allows for high-quality single-unit isolation.

Tones could elicit either an increase or a decrease in a neuron's firing rate over the background firing rate, or both; the change could be transient, delayed, or sustained; and the response pattern could be different for different tone frequencies in a single neuron.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows some examples of the range of response types we observed. In one neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), tones elicited a transient, short latency response of the sort commonly observed in the barbiturate-anesthetized auditory cortex. In a second neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), tones elicited a suppression of background activity. In a third neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), higher frequency tones (&#x0223c;8&#x02013;40 kilohertz [kHz]) elicited vigorous sustained firing; interestingly, lower-frequency tones elicited transient responses in the same neuron, emphasizing that the distinction between &#x0201c;transient&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;sustained&#x0201d; applies to responses, not neurons. Other more complex response patterns were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g002">Figure 2</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g002">2</xref>G.) Finally, half of the neurons tested (50%, see below) showed no change in firing rate for any stimulus presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g002">Figure 2</xref>H). Because a given neuron could show very different response patterns to stimuli of different frequencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), we could not find a simple and objective scheme for organizing neurons into a small number of distinct classes, such as &#x0201c;transient,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;sustained,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;off,&#x0201d; etc. The neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g002">Figure 2</xref> are a subset; the complete set of responses from the entire dataset is shown in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060016-sg004">Figures S4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060016-sg008">S8</xref>.</p><fig id="pbio-0060016-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Sound-Evoked Responses in the Unanesthetized Auditory Cortex Are Heterogeneous</title><p>(A&#x02013;H) Tone-evoked responses in the auditory cortex of unanesthetized rats are heterogeneous.

The higher mean rates reflect the fact that in some neurons, some frequencies evoked vigorous firing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g002">Figure 2</xref>C for an example). However, such well-driven responses were the exception rather than the rule; as quantified below, most neurons did not respond vigorously to any of the tones presented. Note that for a neuron to contribute on average at least one spike to the population representation of a sound in a 50-ms window, its evoked firing rate must exceed 20 sp/s.</p><p>To assess whether the low firing rates resulted from some intrinsic defect of the spike-generating mechanism, perhaps introduced by the cell-attached recording method, we extracted the shortest interspike interval (ISI) for each neuron. In most neurons, the shortest ISI was less than 10 ms (median shortest ISI = 4 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 145 cells). Thus, the low firing rates do not appear to arise from an intrinsic inability of neurons to fire rapidly, but instead presumably arise from differences in the synaptic drive received by different neurons.</p><p>The distribution of spontaneous firing rates across the population was remarkably well fit with a lognormal distribution&#x02014;that is, the logarithm of the firing rates was well fit with a Gaussian distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g003">3</xref>C). Because the lognormal distribution has a &#x0201c;heavy tail,&#x0201d; most spikes were generated by just a few neurons: About 16% of neurons&#x02014;the subset of 23 neurons firing at higher than 9.5 sp/s&#x02014;accounted for 50% of all spikes. The lognormal distribution fit better than the exponential distribution, particularly at low firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g004">Figure 4</xref>); because we were using cell-attached recording, we were confident that we were not undersampling the low-firing end of the distribution and that therefore this improved fit was real.

That is, only a few percent of the neuronal population was likely to fire one or more &#x0201c;extra&#x0201d; action potentials (above baseline-firing rate) within any 50-ms window, regardless of the stimulus (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060016-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>Such a sparse response might seem incompatible with evidence from other recording technologies, such as multiunit recordings (or fMRI), indicating that tones and other stimuli can indeed elicit substantial increases in population activity. However, these lines of evidence can be reconciled: even though only a small fraction of neurons was highly active at any instant, the activity in this small fraction could lead to as much as a 50% increase in the mean (as opposed to the median) firing rate (e.g., 4.9 versus 7.0 sp/s during the early tone epoch; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060016-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus the presentation of a stimulus caused only a barely discernible change in the activity of most of the population; but an appreciable number of extra spikes were concentrated in a small fraction of neurons.</p><p>Although the distributions of firing rate changes were similar across stimulus ensembles, we did observe minor differences in the mean driven rate among ensembles. As expected, louder tones elicited a greater population response than quiet tones. Perhaps surprisingly, simple spectrotemporally rich stimuli (sweeps) elicited a somewhat greater response than did complex stimuli (natural sounds). Nevertheless, these differences were relatively small, and qualitatively the ensembles elicited similarly sparse population responses.</p><p>The analysis so far has focused on the fraction of well-driven neurons. What fraction of neurons showed any detectable stimulus-locked change at all, beyond those predicted by chance fluctuations around the baseline? Note that the definition we use here for responsiveness is quite inclusive: Even if a tone elicited only a 1 sp/s increase over the baseline-firing rate, this response might still be deemed responsive if the spontaneous rate was sufficiently low for us to detect a change.</p><p>The majority of neurons showed no discernible response to any stimulus during any given response epoch. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows the evoked population response to each stimulus ensemble (with the exception of natural stimuli and white-noise bursts, for which not enough repetitions were presented; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

However, we found that sparseness was not achieved through narrow frequency tuning. Instead, it arose through a combination of factors. First, 50% of the neural population failed to respond to any of the simple stimuli we presented. Second, responses were often brief; in many neurons, the change in firing rate was limited to just one of the three response epochs. Thus, sparseness of the response in time contributed to the overall sparseness of the population response. Finally, even when changes occurred they were typically small; the increase in firing rate exceeded 20 sp/s in only about a quarter of the statistically significant responses. As a result, only a small fraction of neurons responded vigorously to any tone even though frequency tuning was broad.</p><p>The form of sparseness we report has sometimes been termed &#x0201c;population sparseness,&#x0201d; to distinguish it from &#x0201c;lifetime sparseness&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

Population sparseness refers to the response of the population to a given stimulus.

Since the recording electrodes were aligned approximately perpendicular to the cortical surface, the cells recorded in a single electrode penetration likely belonged to the same or neighboring cortical column.</p><p>We did not detect any clustering of response patterns; highly responsive cells were often very near unresponsive cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g007">Figure 7</xref>A shows an example with five neurons recorded over two penetrations (three in one penetration, and two more in a penetration approximately 50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;m ventro-caudal from the first penetration). In the first penetration, one neuron was unresponsive, one showed suppression over a wide range of frequencies, and the third showed enhanced firing over an even wider range of frequencies.

Alternatively or additionally, responsiveness might be correlated with single neuron properties such as type, morphology, and molecular expression pattern. Although in this study we did not recover neurons for histological analysis and so could not assess whether there was a correlation with morphology or molecular expression pattern, we did attempt to correlate responsiveness with cell type.</p><p>Cortical neurons can be grouped into two broad classes: excitatory neurons that release glutamate at their synapses; and inhibitory interneurons, which release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Most cortical neurons are excitatory. GABAergic neurons can have diverse morphological, physiological, or molecular characteristics [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Excitatory and inhibitory neurons can also be distinguished based on a variety of physiological parameters [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In particular, the firing rate of some inhibitory interneurons&#x02014;the so-called fast-spiking subtype&#x02014;is higher when stimulated by current injection. Spike width and shape have been used in previous studies to assign spikes recorded extracellularly in vivo to putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons in hippocampus [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and cortex [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We therefore asked whether spike shape might predict response patterns in our sample.</p><p>Based on previous studies (for example, [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), we expected that fast-spiking interneurons would likely have narrow and symmetric spikes. For each cell we therefore computed the spike width, and also the &#x0201c;spike amplitude index&#x0201d; as a measure of spike symmetry (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). For our population of cells the spike widths ranged from 0.4 ms to 1.9 ms, with a median value of 0.9 ms. We defined the spike amplitude index as the absolute value of the spike peak-to-valley-ratio. A spike amplitude index of unity indicates a perfectly symmetrical spike, whereas a value greater than unity indicates a tall spike, and a smaller value indicates a spike with a deep valley; a fast-spiking interneuron would be expected to have a low spike amplitude index. Spike amplitude indices ranged from 0.8 to 34.3, with a median value of 2.0.</p><p>Neurons with higher evoked firing rates tended to have narrower spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g008">Figure 8</xref>A), suggesting that interneurons were overrepresented among the most responsive neurons.

Neurons with high firing rates also tended to have symmetrical spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Although spike width and shape are only at best crude surrogates for cell type, the striking correlation between these quantities and tone responsiveness suggest that a substantial fraction of the most responsive neurons may be interneurons.</p><fig id="pbio-0060016-g008" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Very Responsive Neurons Might Be Narrow-Spiking Interneurons</title><p>Neurons with higher evoked firing rates tended to have narrow, symmetrical spikes.</p><p>(A) Spike width decreased with increasing evoked firing rate (<italic>n</italic> = 144 neurons).</p><p>(B) Neurons with higher mean evoked firing rates displayed more symmetrical spikes.

In conventional recording, single-unit isolation requires neural activity and neurons with low firing rates&#x02014;spontaneous or evoked&#x02014;tend to be undersampled. During patch clamp recording, by contrast, the formation of an electrical seal does not require neuronal activity and the tip of a glass patch pipette is in physical contact with the neuron, so even neurons with very low firing rates are as likely to be included in the sample as those with high firing rates.</p><p>Although lognormal distributions have been used widely to describe the interspike interval distributions from a single neuron, population responses have usually reported to be exponentially distributed [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The exponential and lognormal distributions differ most dramatically at the low end: a lognormally distributed population has fewer nearly silent neurons (e.g., neurons with a firing rate lower than 0.1 sp/s) than an exponential population. However, because the cell-attached recording method that we used is not biased away from such nearly silent neurons, we could be confident that their underrepresentation in the population was not due to experimental undersampling. It would be of interest to see whether a lognormal distribution of firing rates is seen in neuronal datasets obtained using different recording techniques with similar recording biases, such as optical [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], tetrodes [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], or silicone probes [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, lognormal distributions have recently been reported in another neurobiological context.

However, the sparseness of representations in the auditory cortex has not been explicitly addressed in previous work.

One intuition underlying this approach is that it can be easier to recognize a sparse pattern in a high-dimensional space than a dense pattern in a low dimensional space.

A small craniotomy (maximum size of 1.5 &#x000d7; 1.5 mm) and durotomy were performed over the left (primary) auditory cortex. The position of the craniotomy was determined by its distance from bregma (4.5 mm posterior and 4 mm lateral), and its relationship to other bone sutures. The presence of clear auditory single-unit responses and/or local field potentials was further used as physiological criteria to confirm the location of the auditory cortex. Based on the anatomical landmarks and physiological criteria we expect that the neurons recorded in this study were in the primary auditory cortex [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>The whole area was protected by a plastic well with removable cap.

During the recording session, the head of the animal was fixed in the headpost holder and the animal was positioned inside a plastic tube, which provided a loose restraint for body movements.

The animals sat quietly, occasionally moved their limbs, groomed, whisked, etc. The behavioral state of the animal was monitored by a closed video circuit. Excessive movement, signs of stress, or discomfort of the animal were used to indicate the end of the experiment. We recorded from each animal during several recording sessions (usually two or three sessions per rat). The number of recording sessions was limited by the total number of electrode penetrations. Any appearance of brain edema, or a change in cortex appearance, vasculature, etc. was a sign to discontinue recordings from the animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Electrophysiology.</title><p>Cell-attached recordings were obtained using standard blind patch-clamp recording techniques; for details on this technique see also [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].

Recordings were obtained using Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) with 2 kHz lowpass filter and a custom data acquisition system written in MATLAB (Mathworks), with a sampling rate of either 4 kHz or 10 kHz. Because cell-attached recording requires a minimum seal of only about 10&#x02013;20 M&#x003a9; (compared with the &#x0003e;1 G&#x003a9; for whole cell recording), almost every neuron encountered can be patched.</p><p>We recorded from 166 neurons (in 25 animals), out of which we identified 145 neurons (in 24 animals) with at least eight trials per octave bin (see also section titled Cell counts, below). The search for neurons was conducted solely based on pipette's resistance and not on spiking activity. For inclusion in our sample, each cell had to generate at least one action potential (to guarantee that it was not, e.g., a glial cell). A great care was taken to exclude neurons that might have been damaged by direct contact between the pipette tip and cellular membrane. Recordings during which we observed gradual increase in spontaneous firing rate were excluded. In the rare cases, in which the spontaneous rate increased suddenly, or the electrode &#x0201c;broke in&#x0201d; after a sudden movement of the animal, we analyzed only the first stationary epoch of the recording.</p><p>Neurons were recorded from all depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060016-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).

Of those, 23 neurons were also presented with pure tones (14% of recordings, 23 out of 166), and five neurons were presented only with natural sounds. The natural sound stimuli were taken from a commercially available audio compact disc, &#x0201c;The Diversity of Animal Sounds&#x0201d; (Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology), originally sampled at 44.1 kHz and resampled at 97.656 kHz for stimulus presentation [<xref rid="pbio-0060016-b072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The sounds chosen had no special relevance to the rats (unlike, e.g., rat pup calls), and therefore are less likely to engage specialized processing mechanisms; to the extent that these sounds are representative of the acoustic environment of humans, they are also representative for rats, which often share the same habitat as humans. Altogether, four natural sound segments were presented for each neuron, with at least four repeats of each segment per neuron.
