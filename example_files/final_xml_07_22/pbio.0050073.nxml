Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that target an exon or its flanking splice sites usually promote exon skipping. Here we systematically tested a large number of ASOs with a 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methoxy-ethyl ribose (MOE) backbone that hybridize to different positions of <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7, and identified several that promote greater exon inclusion, others that promote exon skipping, and still others with complex effects on the accumulation of the two alternatively spliced products. This approach provides positional information about presumptive exonic elements or secondary structures with positive or negative effects on exon inclusion. The ASOs are effective not only in cell-free splicing assays, but also when transfected into cultured cells, where they affect splicing of endogenous <italic>SMN</italic> transcripts. The ASOs that promote exon 7 inclusion increase full-length SMN protein levels, demonstrating that they do not interfere with mRNA export or translation, despite hybridizing to an exon. Some of the ASOs we identified are sufficiently active to proceed with experiments in SMA mouse models.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe genetic disease that causes motor-neuron degeneration.

Based on the severity and age of onset, SMA is clinically subdivided into types I, II, and III (MIMs 253300, 253550, and 253400), with type I being the most severe [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. SMA has an incidence of approximately one in 6,000 live births, and a carrier frequency of one in 40.</p><p>Loss of function of the <italic>survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1)</italic> gene is responsible for SMA [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mice with homozygous <italic>SMN1</italic> disruption display massive cell death during early embryogenesis [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. SMN protein is ubiquitously expressed and is mainly localized in the cytoplasm and in nuclear &#x0201c;gems&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Multiple SMN-interacting partners have been identified, suggesting the involvement of SMN in various cellular processes, such as transcription, mRNA transport, and assembly of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), including small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs), small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs), and stress granules [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Humans have an extra <italic>SMN</italic> gene copy, designated <italic>SMN2</italic>. Both <italic>SMN</italic> genes reside within a segmental duplication on Chromosome 5q13 as inverted repeats [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. <italic>SMN1</italic> and <italic>SMN2</italic> are almost identical, except for 11 nucleotide substitutions: seven in intron 6, two in intron 7, one in coding exon 7 (a translationally silent C to T transition, relative to <italic>SMN1</italic>), and one in non-coding exon 8 [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>SMN2</italic> is a prototypical example of alternative splicing caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the affected exon. Exon 7 is efficiently included in spliced mRNA from the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene; however, the silent C6T transition in <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7, which weakens the recognition of the upstream 3&#x02032; splice site [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], results in significant skipping of this exon during pre-mRNA splicing. The C6T transition abrogates a splicing factor 2/alternative splicing factor (SF2/ASF)-dependent exonic splicing enhancer (ESE); this SF2/ASF heptamer motif is present in <italic>SMN1</italic> exon 7 (nucleotides +6 to +13, CAGACAA) and supersedes the inhibitory effect of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As a result, <italic>SMN2</italic> encodes mostly the exon 7&#x02013;skipped protein isoform (SMN&#x00394;7), which is unstable, mislocalized, and at best, only partially functional [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although the small amount of full-length SMN protein derived from <italic>SMN2</italic> is not sufficient to fully compensate for loss of <italic>SMN1,</italic> it is essential for viability in the absence of <italic>SMN1,</italic> and is an important disease modifier: in both SMA patients and mouse models, there is an inverse relationship between <italic>SMN2</italic> copy number and disease severity [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These properties define <italic>SMN2</italic> as an ideal therapeutic target for potential treatment of SMA.</p><p>Antisense technology was initially employed to down-regulate gene expression by targeting mRNA to induce its degradation or block its translation [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Advances in antisense chemistry allowed this technology to be applied as a powerful tool to manipulate pre-mRNA splicing. Modification of the base, sugar, or phosphodiester structure of oligonucleotides generates highly stable molecules with not only high affinity for RNA targets, but also resistance to various nucleases, including RNase H (which cleaves RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids). The Kole laboratory pioneered the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to correct aberrant splicing by targeting pre-mRNA, demonstrating both in vitro and in vivo that ASOs can restore correct expression of a defective &#x003b2;-globin gene by blocking the cryptic splice sites generated by intronic mutations that cause &#x003b2;-thalassemia [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Recently, ASO applications to redirect pre-mRNA splicing were extended to genes with therapeutic relevance to cancer or other diseases [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. ASOs have been employed to promote skipping of non-essential exons, so as to restore the translational reading frame and suppress the effects of various deletion, nonsense, and frameshifting alleles of the dystrophin gene <italic>(DMD)</italic> [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although it is now relatively straightforward to block the use of specific exons by targeting the corresponding 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; splice sites or empirically selected sequences within the exon, it remains much more challenging to find suitable antisense targets for promoting exon inclusion.</p><p>Several antisense approaches have been documented to promote <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 splicing. One approach is based on the notion that there is a competition between the 3&#x02032; splice sites of exons 7 and 8 for pairing with the 5&#x02032; splice site of exon 6 [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], so impairing the recognition of the 3&#x02032; splice site of exon 8 should favor exon 7 inclusion. Increased <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 inclusion and full-length SMN protein were indeed observed in HeLa cells transfected with a modified U7 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) complementary to the intron 7/exon 8 junction [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another approach, called TOES (targeted oligonucleotide enhancer of splicing) [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], relies on bifunctional ASOs composed of one segment complementary to exon 7 and a non-complementary tail consisting of RNA sequences with ESE motifs recognized by a serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein. One such bifunctional ASO stimulated <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 inclusion and led to significant restoration of gem number&#x02014;an indicator of SMN protein increase&#x02014;in SMA-patient fibroblasts [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, an in vivo delivery system was recently developed for expression of bifunctional ASOs in an adeno-associated virus vector [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Strong intronic splicing silencers (ISSs) represent ideal antisense targets; however, if present, they are usually inconspicuous within large introns. An ISS in intron 6 was identified in the context of an <italic>SMN2</italic> minigene, and targeting this inhibitory element with an ASO increased exon 7 inclusion in transiently transfected COS-7 cells [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An intron 7 ISS, located immediately downstream of the 5&#x02032; splice site of exon 7, was recently reported; an ASO against this silencer efficiently restored exon 7 inclusion of <italic>SMN2</italic> and increased SMN protein levels in SMA-patient&#x02013;derived cells [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The ESSENCE (exon-specific splicing enhancement by small chimeric effectors) method, which was developed to rescue disease-associated exon skipping or modulate alternative splicing, employs small chimeric effectors designed to emulate SR proteins [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A synthetic ESSENCE molecule comprises two portions: an antisense moiety complementary to a target exon; and a minimal RS domain peptide similar to the splicing activation domain of SR proteins. We described several ESSENCE compounds that significantly promote <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 inclusion in a cell-free splicing assay [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, the antisense moiety alone also significantly stimulates exon 7 inclusion, although with approximately 8-fold less potency compared to ESSENCE compounds, suggesting the existence of an exonic splicing silencer (ESS) in exon 7 [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This observation highlighted the possibility of further optimization of the antisense moiety of ESSENCE compounds to enhance their potency. Here, we used two-step ASO walks along <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 to define position-dependent effects of ASO-binding sites. With the first coarse whole&#x02013;exon 7 walk, we identified two ASO target regions separated by a central core sequence, and with the second high-resolution walks, we identified optimal ASOs against each target region. The two best ASOs strongly promoted exon 7 inclusion during <italic>SMN2</italic> pre-mRNA splicing in three different splicing assays, and increased SMN protein levels in cultured cells, including SMA type I fibroblasts. Thus, appropriate ASOs targeting a coding exon can increase protein levels by promoting exon inclusion and not interfering with translation. Most importantly, the effective ASOs should be suitable for studies in animals and to further optimize bifunctional or peptide-linked ASOs for better efficacy in rescuing <italic>SMN2</italic> splicing and full-length protein expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ASO Walk along <italic>SMN2</italic> Exon 7</title><p>Previously we reported that one PNA (peptide nucleic acid) ASO complementary to positions +7 to +18 of <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 stimulates exon 7 inclusion during splicing in vitro [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This unexpected observation suggested that the ASO blocked one or more putative ESSs&#x02014;either a specific motif or a secondary structure that impairs the recognition of exon 7. To pinpoint the exact locations of these presumptive elements, we used a systematic ASO walk along the entire length of <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7. Oligonucleotides with a 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methoxy-ethyl ribose (MOE) phosphodiester backbone were used. This backbone modification imparts a very high affinity for targeted mRNA, resistance to both exo- and endonucleases, and does not support cleavage of hybridized mRNA by RNase H [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We synthesized nine MOE 15-mer ASOs complementary to the 54-nucleotide (nt) exon 7; beginning with the first position of the exon, the overlapping ASOs provide coverage in 5-nt increments from 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;, with a last step of 4 nt to the last position of the exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050073-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Although the precise extent of exon 7 inclusion varies between extracts or depending on the precise reaction conditions, the difference between <italic>SMN1</italic> and <italic>SMN2</italic> is highly reproducible. We tested eight different concentrations of each ASO, from 1 to 400 nM, compared to no ASO. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, the nine ASOs had different effects on splicing of the <italic>SMN2</italic> pre-mRNA. Four ASOs, 01&#x02013;15, 16&#x02013;30, 21&#x02013;35, and 26&#x02013;40, strongly inhibited exon 7 inclusion; ASOs 11&#x02013;25 and 31&#x02013;45 slightly inhibited exon 7 inclusion; and ASO 40&#x02013;54 and the control oligonucleotide 00&#x02013;00 had no effect on alternative splicing of <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7. Interestingly, we found two ASOs, 06&#x02013;20 and 36&#x02013;50, that significantly stimulated exon 7 inclusion in the cell-free splicing assay, starting at a concentration of approximately 50 nM.</p><p>ASO 01&#x02013;15 targets the exonic portion of the 3&#x02032; splice site, whereas ASOs 11&#x02013;25, 16&#x02013;30, 21&#x02013;35, and 26&#x02013;40 target a central region that comprises a transformer 2 beta 1 protein (Tra2&#x003b2;1)-binding motif in <italic>SMN</italic> exon 7 [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Both elements are required for exon 7 inclusion, which can account for the negative effects of these ASOs. ASO 31&#x02013;45 has a 10-nt overlap with the stimulatory ASO 36&#x02013;50, yet it had a negative effect on splicing of exon 7, suggesting that there is a motif upstream of the ASO 36&#x02013;50-binding site that is also important for exon 7 inclusion. ASO 40&#x02013;54 targets the exonic portion of the exon 7 5&#x02032; splice site; however, it is essentially neutral. We offer two explanations for this observation: first, the exonic portion of this 5&#x02032; splice site deviates from the consensus sequence, and thus ASO 40&#x02013;54 might not affect U1 snRNA base-pairing; second, ASO 40&#x02013;54 has a strong predicted stem-loop structure (unpublished data) and might not bind efficiently to its complementary sequence. It is not surprising that ASO 06&#x02013;20 had a positive effect, because it encompasses the sequence of the antisense PNA we reported previously [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; however, ASO 36&#x02013;50, which is complementary to nucleotides +36 to +50 of exon 7, defines an additional region in <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 that can be targeted to increase exon 7 inclusion.</p><p>To determine whether the ASO-mediated stimulation of exon 7 inclusion can take place in cells, we co-transfected plasmid pCI-SMN2 with each of the nine MOE ASOs into HEK293 cells by electroporation. At the same time, we co-transfected plasmid pBabe Puro and selected the transfected cells by treatment with puromycin. Two days after transfection, we analyzed the transiently expressed RNA by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Each of the ASOs gave similar effects on splicing of exon 7 in the minigene pre-mRNA as observed by in vitro splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), except for two ASOs, 11&#x02013;25 and 31&#x02013;45.

In microwalk A, the target site for the improved ASO 07&#x02013;21 extends to three consecutive As of the proposed Tra2&#x003b2;1-recognition sequence (AAAGAAGGA) [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], suggesting that this portion of the Tra2&#x003b2;1-dependent ESE is not critical for binding of the protein. This interpretation is consistent with the finding that mutating the triple As to triple Us does not abrogate Tra2&#x003b2;1 recognition [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The triple As mark the 3&#x02032; boundary of region A; extending the walk farther downstream causes strong exon 7 skipping, as in the cases of ASOs 08&#x02013;22, 12&#x02013;23, and 11&#x02013;22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g005">5</xref>B), presumably because of interference with Tra2&#x003b2;1 binding. In microwalk B, ASOs that bind farther upstream of the improved ASO 34&#x02013;48, such as 33&#x02013;47, 32&#x02013;46, and 33&#x02013;44, caused a strong reduction in exon 7 inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g005">5</xref>D). These three ASOs are complementary to exon 7 with a 5&#x02032;-most boundary at +33C and +32G, respectively, suggesting that this GC dinucleotide is part of an element or structure important for exon 7 recognition. This observation is also consistent with the in vivo effect of ASO 31&#x02013;45 in the initial exon 7 walk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The combined data from the coarse- and high-resolution antisense walks point to the existence of a core sequence in the middle of exon 7, from +22 to +33, that is essential for exon 7 inclusion.</p><p>The microwalk data obtained from the two in vivo assays are also useful for mapping both the 5&#x02032; boundary of region A and the 3&#x02032; boundary of region B. In microwalk A, ASO 04&#x02013;18 displayed the least stimulatory effects among the 15-mer ASOs; other ASOs that target further upstream sequences were either neutral or inhibitory. These results define the boundaries of region A as +4 to +21. In microwalk B, the 15-mer ASOs 39&#x02013;53 and 38&#x02013;52, whose 3&#x02032;-most complementary-sequence boundaries are +53G and +52G, respectively, were essentially neutral; all other 15-mer ASOs, except 33&#x02013;47 and 32&#x02013;46, which partly target the central core sequence, had stimulatory effects. Therefore, nucleotides +34 to +51 define the boundaries of region B. The results obtained with 12-mer ASOs are generally consistent with those obtained with 15-mer ASOs, except for ASO 04&#x02013;15, which targets region A, but was unexpectedly inhibitory with respect to exon 7 inclusion, and ASO 09&#x02013;20, which also targets region A, but was inhibitory in the in vivo assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Dose-Response and Kinetic Analysis of ASO 07&#x02013;21 and ASO 34&#x02013;48</title><p>The two high-resolution walk exon 7 ASOs were further characterized with respect to their effects on splicing of the endogenous <italic>SMN1/2</italic> genes in HEK293 cells.

However, because the ASOs might remain associated with exon 7 in the spliced mRNA, they could potentially interfere with mRNA export and/or translation. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the stimulatory effect of these ASOs on <italic>SMN1</italic> exon 7 inclusion results in increased full-length SMN protein. We could not accurately determine this in HEK293 cells, because of the high levels of identical SMN protein expressed from the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene. Therefore, we generated another <italic>SMN2</italic> minigene construct, designated pEGFP-SMN2. This minigene consists of an N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), a short cloning-site sequence, a hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA tag), <italic>SMN</italic> exon 6, a shortened intron 6 (same as in minigene pCI-SMN2), exon 7, intron 7, and the 5&#x02032; end of exon 8 (75 nt) at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). When the pre-mRNA from this minigene is spliced, it generates two mRNAs via exon inclusion or skipping. Translation of the exon 7&#x02013;included mRNA gives a larger protein of 308 amino acids (designated P-Incl), comprising EGFP, seven amino acids (SGLRSRE) derived from the cloning site, the HA tag, and exons 6 and 7 of SMN. The exon 7&#x02013;skipped mRNA is translated into a smaller protein of 296 amino acids (designated P-Excl), comprising EGFP, SGLRSRE, the HA tag, exon 6, and four amino acids (EMLA) from exon 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Both proteins can be detected with anti-HA antibody. Before proceeding to the protein-level analysis, we first verified the increase in exon 7 inclusion for the minigene pEGFP-SMN2 after electroporation with ASO 07&#x02013;21 or 34&#x02013;48. Compared with the endogenous <italic>SMN2</italic> gene, minigene pEGFP-SMN2 favors the exon 7&#x02013;skipped mRNA isoform.

Protein samples were generated 3 d after the cells were co-transfected via electroporation with the minigene construct and either ASO at 10 or 30 &#x003bc;M concentration.

To overcome this problem, we constructed another <italic>SMN2</italic> minigene, pEGFP-SMN2&#x00394;6; this construct is similar to pEGFP-SMN2, but lacks most of exon 6, except for the last 9 nt, so as to maintain an intact natural 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). This minigene encodes two protein isoforms: the exon 7&#x02013;included one (P-Incl&#x00394;6; 274 amino acids) and the exon 7&#x02013;excluded one (P-Excl&#x00394;6; 262 amino acids). Using this minigene, we again tested ASO 07&#x02013;21 or 34&#x02013;48 in HEK293 cells; significant increases in both exon 7&#x02013;included mRNA and protein were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g007">7</xref>C).

After treatment with the ASOs, the P-Excl&#x00394;6 band disappeared, whereas the P-Incl&#x00394;6 band became considerably stronger and comparable in intensity to the <italic>SMN1</italic> minigene product. To control for sample loading differences, the same blots were reprobed with anti&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin monoclonal antibody.

The ratio increased by approximately 1.6-fold in ASO 07&#x02013;21-treated cells and approximately 1.8-fold in ASO 34&#x02013;48-treated cells. To detect changes at the protein level, we used &#x003b1;-tubulin as a loading control. The normalized ratio significantly increased by approximately 1.8-fold and approximately 2.1-fold in ASO 07&#x02013;21- and ASO 34&#x02013;48-treated samples, respectively, compared to ASO 00&#x02013;00 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Assuming a delivery efficiency of approximately 50%, the actual effects should be approximately 2-fold greater in the cells that took up the ASOs.</p><fig id="pbio-0050073-g008" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Effect of ASOs 07&#x02013;21 and 34&#x02013;48 in SMA Type I Patient 3813 Fibroblasts</title><p>Endogenous <italic>SMN2</italic> mRNA, SMN protein levels, and gem number were analyzed after each ASO at a concentration of 100 nM was transfected into patient fibroblasts using Lipofectin.

Mechanistic studies to understand how <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 is alternatively spliced led to the discovery of several <italic>cis</italic>-elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that can be targeted to stimulate exon 7 inclusion [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A number of drugs, including synthetic compounds that can modify <italic>SMN2</italic> splicing, have been identified using cell-based high-throughput drug screening [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. On the basis of the current knowledge of splicing mechanisms, we and others have employed antisense-based technologies to stimulate exon 7 inclusion. In recent years, a growing number of studies have demonstrated that MOE-modified ASOs (with a phosphodiester or a phosphorothioate backbone) and antisense PNAs can be valuable tools, not only for dissecting gene function, but also for clinical applications [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our previous work showed that ESSENCE compounds have the potential to treat diseases caused by exon skipping resulting from the loss of ESEs in mutant genes, including <italic>SMN2</italic> [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A critical parameter in ESSENCE effectiveness is the selection of the optimal binding site along a target exon. In principle, the best target sequences are those that comprise negative exonic splicing signals or secondary structures, such as ESSs.</p><p>In this study, we systematically analyzed <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 with a large number of MOE ASOs to identify putative ESSs. We employed a two-step ASO walk method, with an initial coarse ASO walk in 5-nt steps along the entire exon, followed by high-resolution single-nucleotide walks within the regions identified in the first step. With the first-step walk, we identified two ASO targets of potential therapeutic importance. The second-step microwalks optimized the ASOs and defined the apparent boundaries of the two ESS-containing regions. Using three independent splicing assays, we identified two potent ASOs that have significant therapeutic potential for SMA treatment. Our data also suggest that the two-step ASO walk is a powerful general method that can be used for screening inhibitory or stimulatory splicing regions present in the target exon(s) and the surrounding intron sequences of any gene.</p><p>Our data revealed an essential core sequence in the center of the 54-nt exon 7 from +22 to +33 (GAAGGAAGGTGC), which is surrounded by two separate inhibitory regions (A and B) containing negative splicing signals, with region A extending close to the upstream 3&#x02032; splice site (+4 to +21) and region B extending close to the downstream 5&#x02032; splice site (+34 to +51) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Blocking any part of the central core sequence promoted efficient skipping of exon 7, whereas blocking either of the two inhibitory regions promoted exon 7 inclusion. The 5&#x02032; portion of the central core sequence comprises a previously identified Tra2&#x003b2;1-binding motif (GAAGGA) [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; the 3&#x02032; part (AGGTGC) may represent another <italic>cis</italic>-acting element that is also crucial for exon 7 recognition. A relatively long conserved sequence in the middle of exon 7, surrounded by two short inhibitory sequences, was previously identified by an iterative in vitro selection method [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Through an analysis of mutability, three segmental sequences with negative or positive <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements were inferred: the most conserved residues are located in the middle and form a conserved tract (+16 to +44), whereas the highly mutable upstream nucleotides form an inhibitory region (+3 to +15), and seven highly mutable downstream nucleotides (+45 to +51) form another negative element [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our data sharpen the boundaries for these three segments, as verified by three different splicing assays and several ASOs, particularly the two most effective ASOs, 07&#x02013;21 and 34&#x02013;48. The target sequence of the 15-mer ASO 07&#x02013;21 overlaps by six nucleotides with the previously reported conserved tract, and 11 out of 15 target nucleotides of ASO 34&#x02013;48 are part of this conserved track. Nucleotides A36 and C37, which fall within the inhibitory region B, have been suggested to be part of a stimulatory motif, as the double mutation A36U/C37U abolishes exon 7 inclusion in the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, the double mutation might create a stronger inhibitory motif, or strengthen a secondary RNA structure that impairs exon 7 recognition.</p><fig id="pbio-0050073-g009" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Schematic Diagram of the In Vivo Effects of All Tested ASOs on Exon 7 Inclusion</title><p>An essential core sequence (in bold) surrounded by two inhibitory regions, A and B (boxed), in <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7.

PESX found no ESS motifs, whereas ACESCAN2 found three putative ESS motifs: GGTTTT (+1 to +6), TTTTAG (+3 to +8) and TTCCTT (+39 to +44). The first two motifs partially overlap with the inhibitory region A, and the last motif resides within the inhibitory region B, so these motifs might contribute to the inhibitory properties of regions A and B.</p><p>We note that both optimized ASOs are 15-mers, whereas all five of the 18-mer ASOs (36&#x02013;53, 35&#x02013;52, 34&#x02013;51, 33&#x02013;50, and 32&#x02013;49) displayed more or less inhibitory effects on <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 inclusion. The longer 18-mer ASOs are likely to overlap two or more binding sites, resulting in complex effects. The strong inhibitory effect of ASO 32&#x02013;49 and the relatively weak inhibitory effect of ASO 33&#x02013;50 might be explained by their interference with the positive regulation conferred by the essential core sequence, because the 5&#x02032;-most boundary nucleotide of their target sequence is 33G and 34C, respectively. The other three ASOs, whose target sequences lie next to the exon&#x02013;intron junction, might interfere with recognition of the 5&#x02032; splice site.</p><p>A small fraction of the ASOs had inconsistent effects on exon 7 splicing in the different splicing assays. One type of inconsistency occurred between the minigene splicing assays (both in vitro and in vivo) and the endogenous gene assay. The other type of inconsistency occurred between the in vitro splicing assay and the in vivo splicing assays. The first type of inconsistency may reflect the differences in the pre-mRNA substrates, although <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 was identical in all the assays. In both the in vitro splicing assay and the in vivo minigene splicing assay, a small minigene was used. Higher-order structure differences between the small minigene pre-mRNA and the much larger endogenous pre-mRNA might affect the accessibility of some ASOs to their target sequences in exon 7, resulting in splicing differences. The second type of inconsistency might reflect differences in the splicing-reaction environments between the cell-free splicing assay and the cell-based splicing assays, even though in general, the in vitro splicing reactions accurately reproduce cellular splicing events. For example, it is possible that the effects of some ASOs are more sensitive to changes in the concentration of certain splicing factors resulting from the nuclear extraction procedure. Another possibility is that the discrepancies result from kinetic differences and the coupling between transcription and mRNA processing that normally occurs in vivo, but not in standard in vitro splicing reactions [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; moreover, transcription from different promoters&#x02014;as in the minigene and the endogenous gene&#x02014;can also affect use of alternative cassette exons in vivo [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Why ASOs 07&#x02013;21 and 34&#x02013;48 are more effective than the original ones, which bind to their target sequences only one or two nucleotides upstream or downstream, is currently under investigation. Because the ASOs have the same lengths and the same or similar G/C contents, annealing kinetics is probably not the cause, assuming equal accessibility to their target sites in exon 7. Two possible explanations of the effects of ASOs 07&#x02013;21 and 34&#x02013;48 are that they precisely block one or more splicing silencers, or efficiently disrupt an inhibitory RNA secondary structure. It has been reported that hnRNP A1 can inhibit <italic>SMN2</italic> and <italic>SMN1</italic> exon 7 inclusion [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In region A of <italic>SMN2,</italic> SF2/ASF presumably fails to block the cooperative propagation of hnRNP A1, due to the loss of an SF2/ASF motif caused by the C6T transition [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. ASO 07&#x02013;21 binds a 15-nt sequence that spans the mutant SF2/ASF motif; therefore, it is reasonable to assume that one of the roles played by ASO 07&#x02013;21 is similar to a proposed function of SF2/ASF in <italic>SMN1</italic> exon 7, i.e., blocking the propagation of hnRNP A1. ASO 07&#x02013;21 might also block other inhibitory motifs residing in region A, for which an extended inhibitory context has been proposed [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We have unexpectedly observed in microwalk A that the 12-mer ASO 04&#x02013;15 inhibited exon 7 inclusion; ASO 09&#x02013;20 was likewise inhibitory, at least in vivo. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of region A is the result of interplay among multiple <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. It is likely that ASOs 04&#x02013;15 and 09&#x02013;20 can effectively block an undefined weak stimulatory signal, but cannot efficiently block the propagation of hnRNP A1 and possibly other repressors. A terminal-stem loop has been predicted in the less-studied region B, extending to two intron 7 nucleotides [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Though it is possible that the inhibitory property of region B is attributable to the proposed RNA secondary structure itself, other possibilities cannot be ruled out, including the existence of one or more splicing repressors that recognize a specific motif or RNA structure. Additional experimental studies will be required to elucidate the precise splicing-stimulatory mechanism of ASO 34&#x02013;48.</p><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that the stimulatory ASOs act in part by stabilizing the pre-mRNAs and/or mRNAs to which they hybridize. Because only some of the exon 7 ASOs stimulate exon 7 inclusion, such a stabilization effect would presumably involve masking of specific instability elements. However, the effect of the ASOs is primarily, if not exclusively, at the level of splicing, because an effect at the level of mRNA half-life should result in the same proportional increase in <italic>SMN1</italic> and <italic>SMN2</italic> full-length mRNAs, yet the effects on <italic>SMN1</italic> were much smaller, consistent with a switch in alternative splicing from the low basal level of exon 7&#x02013;skipped mRNA. In addition, we did not observe any ASO-mediated stabilization of the labeled pre-mRNA in the in vitro splicing experiments.</p><p>We used three different assays to demonstrate that the ASOs that promote exon inclusion are compatible with synthesis of full-length SMN protein, indicating that they do not block mRNA export or translation. First, we showed that ASOs 07&#x02013;21 and 34&#x02013;48 promote efficient expression of reporter proteins corresponding to exon 7 inclusion in HEK293 cells. Second, we showed that the same ASOs promote expression of full-length SMN protein in primary fibroblasts from a type I SMA patient; though significant, this effect appears subtle because of the relatively low transfection efficiency with these cells. Finally, we showed that the same ASOs promote an increase in the number of nuclear gems detected with anti-SMN antibody in the patient fibroblasts; this single-cell immunofluorescence assay obviates the problem of transfection efficiency and provides an indirect readout for SMN protein levels [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Our initial goal in this study was to define optimal antisense targets to maximize ESSENCE effectiveness. However, our optimized antisense targets should also be useful with bifunctional ASOs [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The antisense portions of the bifunctional ASOs used in two earlier studies were not optimized. The first study used a 15-mer ASO targeting the exon 7 sequence +2 to +16 [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], i.e., the same target sequence as that of our ASO 02&#x02013;16. However, we found that this ASO had a slightly negative effect on exon 7 inclusion in vivo with both the <italic>SMN2</italic> minigene and the endogenous <italic>SMN2</italic> gene, though it had a slightly stimulatory effect on splicing in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g003">Figures 3</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050073-g005">5</xref>A, and 5B). ASO 02&#x02013;16 was one of few ASOs that gave inconsistent effects among the different splicing assays we used. The second study used a 20-mer ASO targeting the exon 7 sequence +6 to +25 [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which partially overlaps the central core sequence that is essential for exon 7 inclusion. On the basis of our results, we predict that more-effective bifunctional ASOs targeting exon 7 can be designed, using the ASO 07&#x02013;21 or 34&#x02013;48 sequences as the antisense moiety.</p><p>Although we expect that even more-potent effectors can be designed by attaching ASOs 07&#x02013;21 or 34&#x02013;48 to activation-domain peptides or SR protein&#x02013;binding sites&#x02014;as in the ESSENCE [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and TOES [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] methods&#x02014;these ASOs appear to be sufficiently effective on their own to be tested in animal models of SMA. ASOs with the same chemistry were recently demonstrated to be active modulators of splicing in mice [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. More generally, the antisense walk strategy described here should be applicable to identifying exon-targeting ASOs that modulate alternative splicing of normal or mutant genes. At the same time, these ASOs can facilitate the identification of important <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences that can be further investigated to elucidate splicing mechanisms, and to identify <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that may be useful molecular targets for disease therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Oligonucleotide synthesis.</title><p>Synthesis and purification of chimeric 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methoxyethyl&#x02013;modified oligonucleotides with a phosphodiester backbone were performed using an Applied Biosystems 380B automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) as described previously [<xref rid="pbio-0050073-b049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

After overnight growth, the cells were transfected with 100 nM oligonucleotides. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min, blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 3% IgG-free bovine serum albumin [BSA]), and incubated for 3 h in blocking buffer containing mouse monoclonal anti-SMN antibody. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 2 h in blocking buffer containing goat anti-mouse secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). The cells were again washed with PBS three more times, and coverslips were mounted with Prolong Gold mounting solution containing DAPI (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) for nuclear staining. Cells were analyzed using an Axioplan 2i fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, New York, United States) equipped with Chroma filters (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, Vermont, United States). OpenLab software (Improvision, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.improvision.com">http://www.improvision.com</ext-link>) was used to collect digital images from a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, New Jersey, United States). To count gems, first a field was randomly selected using the DAPI channel, the cell number was determined based on the DAPI counterstaining, and then the gems were counted in the red channel. At least three different fields were counted, and each field contained more than 40 cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The UniProt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pir.uniprot.org">http://www.pir.uniprot.org</ext-link>) accession number for SMN is Q16637&#x02013;1.
